* conducive to virtue
* virtue creating (by inculcating wisdom for living well)
* virtue producing <This aretegenic function of theology was at the heart of theology prior to modernity>

Notes:

Ellen T. Charry’s 1997 book, "By the Renewing of Your Minds", is biblical, historical and systematic theology that serves the goal of “aretegenic” reflection. 

Accoprding to Charry, theology's purpose is to enable us to live more excellent lives. To support this point, she coins the word "aretegenic," meaning "conducive to virtue" (from the Greek arete, "virtue," and gennao, "to beget").
