#To withdraw from membership in a federation or alliance.

====Usage note====

*The term ''secede'' is sometimes incorrectly used by American speakers to refer to a declaration of independence by a territory that forms part of a unitary state.  If Corsica declares independence from France, or Scotland from the United Kingdom, then this is not secession because constitutionally France and the UK are unitary states, not federal states.  If Texas gains independence from the US, on the other hand, that is secession, because Texas is part of a federation.
