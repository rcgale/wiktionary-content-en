In [[radio]] communications, a '''forward link''' is the link from a fixed location (e.g., a [[base station]]) to a mobile user. If the link includes a [[communications satellite|communications relay satellite]], the forward link will consist of both an [[uplink]] (base station to satellite) and a [[downlink]] (satellite to mobile user).
