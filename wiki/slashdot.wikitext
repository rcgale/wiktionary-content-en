==Etymology==

From the popular geek news site Slashdot (http://www.slashdot.org).

Slashdot posts news stories about myriad computer-related topics.  Many articles are hosted on large commercial and educational sites, but some stories -- often personal pages such as "how to build your own rollecoaster", etc.. -- are hosted on limited-bandwidth connections.  Slashdot's large readership can quickly overwhelm the limited [[bandwidth]], [[processor]] power, etc... of small servers, effecting a pseduo-[[DDOS]] attack.  Thus, a server that swamped with requests is known as being ''slashdotted''.
