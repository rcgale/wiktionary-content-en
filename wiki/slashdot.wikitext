==English==

===Etymology===
From the popular geek news site Slashdot (http://slashdot.org).  Alegedly the name came about in a conversation about how difficult it would be to convey an [[URL]] over the [[telephone]]...resulting in: ache-tee-tee-pee colon slash slash slashdot dot org.

Slashdot posts news stories about myriad computer-related topics.  Many articles are hosted on large commercial and educational sites, but some stories -- often personal pages such as "how to build your own rollercoaster", etc.. -- are hosted on limited-bandwidth connections.  Slashdot's large readership can quickly overwhelm the limited [[bandwidth]], [[processor]] power, etc... of small servers, effecting a pseduo-[[DDOS]] attack.  Thus, a server that swamped with requests is known as being ''slashdotted''.
