'''vibrator'''
#A device that vibrates or causes vibration, sometimes used for massage or sexual stimulation.
#A device designed to electromechanically interupt current flowing to the step up transformer which was used to generate the high tension positive supply in old battery operated (automotive) valve radios.  The two basic types were non-synchronous requiring rectification after the transformer (which was lossy in those days) and the more efficient albeit less reliable, synchronous variety where rectification was performed by an additional set of contacts.  Considering their size, usual shape and operating frequency it is possible these could have been utilised by temperature tolerant early adopters per (1) above.  More certainly, though not so considered at the time, they were an integral part of an early form of switch-mode power supply.
