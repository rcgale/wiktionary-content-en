Flowing like honey.  Sweet and smooth; generally used of a person's voice, tone or writing style.  From the Latin ''mellitus'' (honey).  See also: [[dulcet]] from the Latin: ''dulce'' (sweet).

Mellifluous is more likely to be applied to a person's writing style while dulcet would only be appropriate for describing audible tone, voice or tenor.
