===Proper noun===
God's Name. Believed by some modern scholars to have been pronounced like either ''[[Yahweh]]''. Other evidence points to a name of three syllables. 'Jehovah' (Yehovah) has been the usual pronunciation for centuries. Out of misplaced reverence for God's holy Name, the Hebrews gradually stopped pronouncing it.


=== Etymology ===
Causative fom ([[Hiphil]]) of the verb "havah" (הוה) "to be / to become". "He causes to be" or "He comes to be".

It has generally been said that the form of God's Name "Jehovah" was a Latin mis-transliteration of the Hebrew consonants "YHVH" or "JHWH", because the Name was dotted with the vowel-ponts of the word "Adonay" (Lord) or "Elohim" (God).
However, commentators as Rashi usually refered to it as "Shem Hameforash", that is: "The Name, Pronounced according to it's letters."

Some have remarked that the letters are a rearrangement of the three words: "was" (haya, היה) "is" (ho-veh, הווה) and "shall be" (ye-hi-yeh, יהיה), implying the concept of His eternal existence.  Such speculative etymologies are common for this word.
