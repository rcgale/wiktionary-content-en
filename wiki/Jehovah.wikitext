=== Etymology ===
From a Latin mis-transliteration of the Hebrew consonants "YHVH" or also "JHWH", indirectly suggesting "one who causes to become or be" in Hebrew.  

Even in Hebrew there is no agreed pronunciation, since only the consonants are known with any degree of certainty.
Some have remarked that the letters are a rearrangement of the three words: "was" (haya, היה) "is" (ho-veh, הווה) and "shall be" (ye-hi-yeh, יהיה), implying the concept of His eternal existence.  Such speculative etymologies are common for this word, 

===Proper noun===
#A scriptural name in the Hebrew supreme being.  Believed by some translators to have been pronounced like either ''[[Yahweh]]'' or Jehovah in the original Hebrew, but actually never pronounced aloud even by the ancient Hebrews.
