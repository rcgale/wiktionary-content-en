== [[proper noun]] ==
#God's personal name in the Hebrew Scriptures.  Believed by some translators to have been pronounced like either ''[[Yahweh]]'' or Jehova in the original Hebrew, but actually never pronounced aloud even by the ancient Hebrews.

=== Etymology ===
From a Latin mis-transliteration of the Hebrew consonants "YHVH" or also "JHWH", indirectly meaning "one who causes to become or be" in Hebrew.  

Even in Hebrew there is no agreed upon pronunciation, since the word exists only as God's "proper" name and not as any standalone word. 

Specifically, the letters are a rearrangement of the three words: "was" (haya, היה) "is" (ho-veh, הווה) and "shall be" (ye-hi-yeh, יהיה), incorporating the concept of His eternal existence.
