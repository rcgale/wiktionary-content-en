"Epi meta ta physika"
The science of that which adds itself up to metaphysics either from itself or from the outside, extending as far metaphysics beyond as metaphysics does from physics.
The science which studies laws governing exceptions and explaining the supplementary universe; or less ambitiously, describing an universe which can and should be seen instead of the traditional one, its laws nothing more than correlations of exceptions with a larger frequency.
'''The science of imaginary solutions which attributes symbolically the features to their objects described in their virtuality.'''
The science of exceptions given that only exceptions exist and that any rule stands for an exception to the exceptions.
