====Quotations====
<blockquote>
Mrs. Barrymore is of interest to me.  She is a heavy, solid person,
very limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be puritanical.
You could hardly conceive a less emotional subject.  Yet I have
told you how, on the first night here, I heard her sobbing bitterly,
and since then I have more than once observed traces of tears upon
her face.  Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her heart.  Sometimes
I wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts her, and sometimes
I suspect Barrymore of being a domestic tyrant.  I have always
felt that there was something singular and questionable in this
man's character, but the adventure of last night brings all my
suspicions to a head.
<BR>&mdash; A. Conan Doyle in ''The Hound of the Baskervilles''
