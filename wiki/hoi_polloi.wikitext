==English==
===Etymology===
From Greek [[οἱ]] (hoi, ''the'') and [[πολλοί]] (polloi, ''many'')

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|/ˌhɔɪ pəˈlɔɪ/}}
* {{SAMPA}} /<tt>%hOI p@"lOI</tt>/

===Noun===
'''hoi polloi''' (''uncountable'')
# Common people; the masses
# The elite

====Synonyms====

===Usage note===
* The position of '''hoi''' as a definite article is generally dismissed in usage, meaning the construction "''the hoi polloi''" is acceptable, though some insist that it should not be used.
* The meaning of "''the elite''" is generally held to be formed from a misunderstanding of the original meaning, yet it is quite common.
