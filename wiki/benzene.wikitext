An organic chemical with the formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> whose structure consists of a ring of 6 carbons with alternating and resonating double bonds.

Benzne is known as an "aromatic" compound and has a sweet smell.

It was once used widely as a cleaning product and solvent (even as an aftershave) but common use has stopped because benzene is a known [[carcinogen]].
