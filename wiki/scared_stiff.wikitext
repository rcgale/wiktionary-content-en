==Adjective phrase==

# Describes the [[fear]]-[[induced]] state where an [[animal]] seems [[incapable]] of [[movement]].  This may be an [[adaptive]] response in [[prey]] species, as a [[predator]] is less likely to notice a [[stationary]] object.  May be caused by [[overstimulation]] of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], interfering with control of the animal's actions by [[conscious]] [[brain]] activity.
#: ''He was scared stiff, like a deer in the headlights, by the [[vampire]] walking toward him.  The vampire had to say "[[Boo]]!" to make him get out of the way.''
