=== Etymology ===
Ancient Greek, "par excellence", from [[κατα]] (cata) + [[ἐξοχήν]] (exochēn) "prominence, preeminence".

=== Alternative spellings ===
*[[κατ' ἐξοχήν]] 
*[[kat exochen]], [[kat'exochen]], [[katexochen]] ''(nonstandard)''
*:''Note:'' The apostrophe represents an original elided vowel, thus ''kat' '' for ''kata'' before a word starting with a vowel, which should be used whether English or Greek characters are used.  

=== Adverb ===
'''kat' exochen'''
