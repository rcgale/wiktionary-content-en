'''Mise en place''', literally translated from [[French]], means "''setting in place''."  When cooking, the term is used to describe preparation done before starting the actual cooking process.

[[Recipes]] are reviewed, to check for necessary ingredients and equipment.  Ingredients are measured out, washed, chopped and placed in individual bowls.  Equipment such as [[spatula|spatulas]] and [[blender (device)|blenders]] are prepared for use, while [[ovens]] are preheated.  Preparing the mise en place ahead of time allows the chef to cook without having to stop and assemble items, which is desirable in recipes with time constraints.
