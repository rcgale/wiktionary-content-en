Polaris or palare is a type of slang, used by [[gay]] people and theatrical people, most notably in the 1950s and 1960s. It is derived from fairground slang, backslang, cockney rhymming slang, [[Romany]] and Italian. <p>
A strange feature is that words may be of gay slang or theatrical slang and not neccessarily be palare. For example: ''beard'' is a woman accompanying a gay man, ''super'' is an extra in a play or a film-neither words are polaris. <p>
Some common words in polaris are
