Polaris or palare is a type of slang, used by [[gay]] people and theatrical people, most notably in the 1950s and 1960s. It is derived from fairground slang, backslang, cockney rhyming slang, [[Romany]] and Italian.<p>
A strange feature is that words may be of gay slang or theatrical slang and not necessarily be palare. For example: ''beard'' is a woman accompanying a gay man, ''super'' is an extra in a play or a film - neither words are polaris.<p>
Some common words in polaris are:
<p>
''bona'': good (from the Italian).

''eek'': face.

''riah'': hair (backslang).

''clobber'': clothes, now in common usuage.

''palone'': woman.

''omi'': man.

''omipalone'': homosexual, combination of omi and palone.

''donna'': woman also, from the Italian.

''naph/naff'': not very good, now in common British usuage.

''troll'' : walk (from stroll), used but not commonly.

''mince'' : effeminate walk, used but not commonly. A homosexual may be described as a mincer.
