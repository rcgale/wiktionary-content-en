Noun

Hierophany

Physical manifestation of the holy or sacred.  This manifestation can be in many forms, often in symbols or rituals.  An example of a hierophany would be an apparition or image appearing on a window bearing resemblance to the virgin Mary.  Many believers will think that such an apparition is a sacred message sent by God, and will worship it as a sacred item or a holy item.
