====Quotations====
<blockquote>
&ldquo;Well, that's because he daren't trust you.  But in his heart he
is not a loyal brother.  We know that well.  So we watch him and
we wait for the time to admonish him.  I'm thinking that the time
is drawing near.  There's no room for scabby sheep in our pen.
But if you keep company with a disloyal man, we might think that
you were disloyal, too.  See?&rdquo;
<BR>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in ''The Valley of Fear''
