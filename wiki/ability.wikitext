*Capacity; [[talent]]; [[cleverness]]; faculty; [[capability]]; [[efficiency]]; [[aptitude]]; [[aptness]]; address; [[dexterity]]; skill. [[Ability]], [[Capacity]]. These words come into comparison when applied to the higher intellectual powers. 
*'''Ability''' has reference to the ''active'' exercise of our [[faculties]]. It implies not only native vigor of mind, but that ease and [[promptitude]] of execution which [[arise]] from mental [[training]]. Thus, we speak of the ''ability'' with which a book is written, an argument maintained, a [[negotiation]] carried on, etc. It always something to be ''done'', and the power of ''doing'' it. 
*'''Capacity''' has reference to the ''receptive'' powers. In its higher exercises it [[suppose]]s great [[quickness]] of apprehension and breadth of intellect, with an [[uncommon]] aptitude for [[acquiring]] and [[retaining]] knowledge. Hence it carries with it the idea of ''resources'' and [[undeveloped]] power. Thus we speak of the extraordinary ''capacity'' of such men as Lord Bacon, [[Blaise]] [[Pascal]], and [[Edmund Burke]]. "''Capacity''," says H. Taylor, "is [[requisite]] to [[devise]], and ''ability'' to [[execute]], a great enterprise." The word ''abilities'', in the plural, [[embraces]] both these qualities, and denotes high mental [[endowments]]
