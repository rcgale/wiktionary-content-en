'''Ability''', ''[[noun (part of speech)|noun]]''; ''[[pl (source)|pl]].'' '''Abilities'''(&?;). [F. ''habilet&eacute;'', earlier spelling ''habilit&eacute;'' (with [[silent]] ''h''), L. ''habilitas'' [[aptitude]], ability, fr. ''habilis'' apt. See [[Able]].]

The quality or state of being able; power to perform, whether physical, moral, intellectual, [[conventional]], or legal; capacity; skill or [[competence]] in doing; [[sufficiency]] of strength, skill, [[resources]], etc.; -- in the ''plural'', faculty, [[talent]].

<code>Then the disciples, every man according to his ''ability'', determined to send relief unto the brethren. ''[[Acts xi. 29 (source)|Acts xi. 29]].''</code>

<code>Natural ''abilities'' are like natural plants, that need pruning by study. ''[[Bacon (source)|Bacon]].''</code>

'''Synonyms:''' -- Capacity; [[talent]]; [[cleverness]]; faculty; [[capability]]; [[efficiency]]; [[aptitude]]; [[aptness]]; address; [[dexterity]]; skill. [[Ability]], [[Capacity]]. These words come into comparison when applied to the higher intellectual powers. ''Ability'' has reference to the ''active'' exercise of our [[faculties]]. It implies not only native vigor of mind, but that ease and [[promptitude]] of execution which [[arise]] from mental [[training]]. Thus, we speak of the ''ability'' with which a book is written, an argument maintained, a [[negotiation]] carried on, etc. It always something to be ''done'', and the power of ''doing'' it. ''Capacity'' has reference to the ''receptive'' powers. In its higher exercises it [[supposes]] great [[quickness]] of apprehension and breadth of intellect, with an [[uncommon]] aptitude for [[acquiring]] and [[retaining]] knowledge. Hence it carries with it the idea of ''resources'' and [[undeveloped]] power. Thus we speak of the extraordinary ''capacity'' of such men as Lord Bacon, [[Blaise]] [[Pascal]], and [[Edmund]] Burke. "''Capacity''," says H. Taylor, "is [[requisite]] to [[devise]], and ''ability'' to [[execute]], a great enterprise." The word ''abilities'', in the plural, [[embraces]] both these qualities, and denotes high mental [[endowments]].
