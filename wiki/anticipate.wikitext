Usage: To [[Anticipate]], [[Expect]]. These words agree in regarding some future event as about to take place. Expect is the stringer. It supposes some ground or reason in the mind for considering the event as likely to happen. Anticipate is, literally, to take beforehand, and here denotes simply to take into the mind as conception of the future. Hence, to say, ''I did not anticipate a refusal,'' expresses something less definite and strong than to say, ''did not expect it.'' Still, anticipate is a convenient word to be interchanged with expect in cases where the thought will allow.
