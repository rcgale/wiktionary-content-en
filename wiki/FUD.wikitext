Colloquially the word '''fud''' has been around a long time in the Glasgow area. Used as an insult, the term "Fud" refers to the female genitalia (specifically in Scotland). "Fud" is seen to be as offensive as "Cunt" and is thought to originate from the percieved sound heard during enthusiastic vaginal intercourse.
