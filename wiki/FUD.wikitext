''For Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt, see [[FUD]].''

Colloquially the word '''fud''' has been around a long time in the Glasgow area. The word means "idiot or acting like an idiot". [http://www.glasgowsurvival.co.uk/toys/glaNedabet.html] (see letter [[F]])

also is a Glaswegian slang term for female genitalia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina]

Not only Glaswegian, but is in fact prevalent across whole of Scottish Central Belt.
