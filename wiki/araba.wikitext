===Quotations===
*'''1845''': I found the examination of these antiquities much less pleasant than to look at the many troops of children assembled on the plain to play; and to watch them as they were dragged about in little queer '''arobas''', or painted carriages, which are there kept for hire. &mdash; William Makepeace Thackeray, ''Notes on a Journey from Cornhill to Grand Cairo'', 1845
*'''1898''':There is, however, such a thing as an “'''araba''',” a vehicle drawn by oxen, in which the wives of a rich man are sometimes dragged four or five miles over the grass by way of recreation. The carriage is rudely framed, but you recognise in the simple grandeur of its design a likeness to things majestic; in short, if your carpenter’s son were to make a “Lord Mayor’s coach” for little Amy, he would build a carriage very much in the style of a Turkish '''araba'''. &mdash; Alexander William Kinglake, ''Eothen'', 1898
*'''1917''':Whenever I mounted the '''araba''', he would whip his horses to a sharp trot or canter for half a mile, and then at a word stop for me to get out. &mdash; W.J. Childs, ''Across Asia Minor on Foot,'' 1917.
