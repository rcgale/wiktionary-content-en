====Usage notes====
*For some time now, it has been common to correct the use of ''tidal wave'' that refers to a disastrous wave caused by a disturbance in the ocean, with the term ''tsunami'' suggested in its stead.  In scientific publications, ''tsunami'' has become the standard term for this phenomenon, though in the mass media and elsewhere, they are used interchangeably and frequently, ''tsunami'' seeing more usage on the whole.

*The sense of ''tidal wave'' that is synonymous with ''tsunami'' has long been in the English language, and relates to the uncommon sense of ''tidal'' that refers to any rise and fall in the water level of any large body of water, and not just the daily rising and falling caused by the moon (see ''[[storm tide]]'', ''[[hurricane tide]]'', and ''[[tidal flood]]'').  While there is nothing that is strictly speaking "incorrect" with regard to this usage of ''tidal wave'', many people believe that the term should simply not be linked with the term ''[[tide]]'' at all, to avoid the possibility of any confusion as to the cause of a tidal wave.

*''Tsunami'' was at one point strongly associated with scientific use, and many people would have considered it pedantic in ordinary conversation, but its prevalence in mass media and popular media has most likely reduced or eliminated this association.  Currently it is a (mostly) non-contentious term that can be used in place of the more contentious and oft-corrected ''tidal wave''.
