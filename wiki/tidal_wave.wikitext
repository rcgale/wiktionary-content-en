{{quot|Tidal_wave}}

==English==

===Pronunciation===
*tīd'əl wāv, /ˈtaɪdəl weɪv/, /<tt>"taId@l weIv</tt>/

===Noun===
'''[[tidal]] [[wave]]''' (tidal waves)

# A crest of ocean water resulting from tidal forces.
# A large ocean wave, particularly one that comes suddenly and causes great damage; a [[tsunami]]. <!-- Don't need to redefine tsunami here -->
#* ''The last tidal wave here killed twenty and left thousands homeless.''
# A sudden and powerful surge.
#* ''I was overcome by a tidal wave of emotions.''

===Usage Note===
The use of ''tidal wave'' as a synonym for ''tsunami'' is often considered incorrect, as tsunamis are not caused by tidal forces.  The usage is, however, long-standing and can be found frequently in the current mainstream media.
