{{quot|Tidal_wave}}

==English==

===Pronunciation===
*tīd'əl wāv, /ˈtaɪdəl weɪv/, /<tt>"taId@l weIv</tt>/

===Noun===
'''[[tidal]] [[wave]]''' (tidal waves)

# A crest of ocean water resulting from tidal forces.
# A large ocean wave, particularly one that comes suddenly and causes great damage; a [[tsunami]]. <!-- Don't need to redefine tsunami here -->
#: ''The last '''tidal wave''' here killed twenty and left thousands homeless.''
# A sudden and powerful surge.
#: ''I was overcome by a '''tidal wave''' of emotions.''

====Usage note====
It is becoming current practice to recommend ''tsunami'' as a correct replacement for the term ''tidal wave'' in the general sense of ''large ocean wave''.  The reasoning is that such waves are generally not caused by tidal forces, and ''tidal wave'' may be used specifically to refer to crests caused by tidal forces.

On the other hand, the use of ''tidal wave'' in the general sense is long-standing and is still frequently found in the mainstream media.  Further, unlike wind-driven waves, which tend to crest and break when reaching shallow water, tsunamis tend to behave like extraordinarily high and fast tidal surges.  This doubtless explains the use of ''tidal'' in the name.  There is no shortage of accounts, particularly older accounts, using ''tidal wave'' in cases that clearly were not caused by tides.
