{{quot|Tidal_wave}}

==English==

===Pronunciation===
*tīd'əl wāv, /ˈtaɪdəl weɪv/, /<tt>"taId@l weIv</tt>/

===Noun===
'''[[tidal]] [[wave]]''' (tidal waves)

# A crest of ocean water resulting from tidal forces.
# A large ocean wave, particularly one that comes suddenly and causes great damage; a [[tsunami]]. <!-- Don't need to redefine tsunami here -->
#* ''The last tidal wave here killed twenty and left thousands homeless.''
# A sudden and powerful surge.
#* ''I was overcome by a tidal wave of emotions.''

====Usage note====
It is becoming current practice to recommend ''tsunami'' as a correct replacement for the term ''tidal wave'' in the general sense of ''large ocean wave'', as most such waves are not caused by tidal forces.  The use of ''tidal wave'' in the general sense is, however, long-standing and may be found frequently in the mainstream media.
