A condition in which clays, polymers or other small charged particles become attached and form a fragile [[structure]], a [[floc]]. In dispersed [[clay]] [[slurries]], flocculation occurs after mechanical agitation ceases and the dispersed clay platelets spontaneously form flocs because of attractions between negative face charges and positive edge charges. 

Antonyms: [[deflocculation]]
