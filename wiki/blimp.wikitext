==English==
===Noun===
#an [[airship]] constructed with a non rigid [[lifting agent]] container.
#a military middle class Englishman intolerant of others' ideas

===Etymology===
Origin uncertain, although some sources suggest that early airship registration forms may have had two categories, '''A''' rigid, and '''B''' limp.  Others suggest that it may be [[onomatopoeia]] for the sound a blimp makes when thumped.

In the sense of an intolerant person, the origin is a reference to the cartoon character Colonel Blimp, created by Sir David Low (1891-1963).
