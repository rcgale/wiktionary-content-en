===Noun===
#an [[airship]] constructed with a non rigid [[lifting agent]] container.
#a military middle class Englishman intolerant of others' ideas

===Etymology===
Origin not entirely certain, however most historians believe that that it is [[onomatopoeia]] for the sound a blimp makes when thumped.
Although there is some disagreement among historians, credit for coining the term is usually given to Lt. A.D. Conningham of the British [[Royal Navy]] in 1915.

There is an often repeated, but false, alternative explanation for the term. The erroneous story is that at some time in the early 20th century, the [[United States]] [[military]] had two classes for airships:  Type A-rigid and Type B-limp, hence "blimp". In fact, 

:''"there was no American 'A-class' of airships as such&mdash;all military aircraft, heavier or lighter-than-air were designated with 'A' until the appearance of B-class airships in May 1917.  There was an American B airship&mdash;but there seems to be no record of any official designation of non-rigids as 'limp'. Further, according to the Oxford Dictionary, the first appearance of the word in print was in 1916, in [[England]], a year before the first B-class airship."'' ("Etymology of 'Blimp'" by Dr. A. D. Topping, ''AAHS Journal'', Winter 1963.)

In the sense of an intolerant person, the origin is a reference to the cartoon character Colonel Blimp, created by Sir David Low (1891-1963).
