    A high stack of shit to shift,
    D’you think I’m the least bit sorry
    That twatty supervisor and those preppy hero fucks
    It’s payraise come early
    Dy’a wonder why most of the bodies in the trade centre were missing

    A good specimin I found the other day
    A decent figured office worker
    Head smashed to a pancake under a breezeblock,
    Legs mangled and twisted
    And an exposed black-red cast of the nicest ass.

    Start to fondle her sores
    And slip inside that brand new orifice.

    Yes the tears and pain are real
    But not what you gullible hacks thinks
    I wince and cry from the lacerations on my penis
    Caused by the asbestos.

    Take this pretty bitch home
    Free food the perks of the job,
    The foods a little singed
    But the jet fuel tenderises the meat

    The final indignity I bestow on the office workers
    I steal their thunder.
