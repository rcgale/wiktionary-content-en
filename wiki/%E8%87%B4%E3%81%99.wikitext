'''致す''' ([[いたす]], [[itasu]])

''Note: in modern Japanese, this word is almost always written in [[hiragana]].''

# To do (the humble version of [[為る]] ([[する]], [[suru]])).

=== Usage note ===
When speaking in formal situations, いたす is used in place of する by the speaker to lower himself in deference to the listener.  This is part of the subset of Japanese formal language ([[敬語]], [[けいご]], [[keigo]]) referred to as "humble" language ([[謙譲語]], [[けんじょうご]], [[kenjōgo]]).  Additionally, this word has found its way into certain common expressions, such as [[どういたしまして]] ([[dōitashimashite]], ''it's all right; you're welcome'').
