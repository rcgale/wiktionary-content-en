'''Dish bitch''' and the less [[derogatory]] '''dish monkey''' are [[slang]] phrases for an [[employee]] of a [[restaurant]] who washes [[dishware]], typically a [[minimum wage]] position where workers are not well-treated.  This is a common job for people who are new to the restaurant industry.

The phrases have also found their way into the world of [[journalism]], referring to reporters who appear via [[satellite]] connections, and correspondingly have to be close to their [[satellite dish]]es.  These reporters often have [[rooftop]] setups and, in many cases, only rarely leave their [[hotel]]s.  News reports made by these journalists therefore have little depth, though they can sometimes produce interesting imagery (such as the bombings that occurred in the [[1991]] [[Gulf War]]).
