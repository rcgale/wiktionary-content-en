Mi amas vin (pronounced ME Amas veen) means "I Love you" in the constructed language [[Esperanto]].

'''Mi''' equals '''I'''.<br>
'''Amas''' is the verb '''Ami''' (to love) conjugated in [[present tense]].<br>
'''Vin''' is the [[direct object]]. It is formed by '''Vi''' (You) and the ending letter '''n''', which is appended to the direct object in a sentence, thus one can say '''Vin mi amas''' or '''Amas vin mi''' and it would mean the same.

Also, we can change the ending letter '''n''' from '''Vin''' to '''Mi''', as in '''Vi amas min''' to express the meaning '''You love me'''.
