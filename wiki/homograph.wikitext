'''homograph''' (''plural'' '''homographs''')

#A word that is [[spell]]ed the same as another but has a different meaning and usually a different [[etymology]] (such as "bear", the animal, and "bear", to support, to tolerate, etc); thus all homographs are [[homonym]]s (but not the other way round)
