==English==
=== Etymology ===
From the name which the book bears in the [[Septuagint]] (''[[Δευτερουόμιου]]'') and in the [[Vulgate]] (''[[Deuteronomium]]''). This is based upon the erroneous Septuagint rendering of "''[[mishnah ha-torah ha-zot]]''" (xvii. 18), which grammatically can mean only "a repetition [that is, a copy] of this law," but which is rendered by the Septuagint ''[[τὸ Δευτερουόμιου τοῦτο]]'', as though the expression meant "this repetition of the law." 

===Proper noun===
'''Deuteronomy'''
#The fifth [[book]] of the [[Hebrew]] [[Bible]], also the fifth book of the [[Christian]] [[Old Testament]].
