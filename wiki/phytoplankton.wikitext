===Etymology===
Greek [[φυτόν]] (phytum) "plant" + [[πλαγκτόν]] (planctum) "wandering".  However, they are no longer classified as plants, so the terminology is showing a historical meaning.

===Noun===
'''phytoplankton''' ([[Uncountable]])

# small [[algae]] and [[fungi]]. They obtain energy by [[photosynthesis]], and live mostly in the upper part of the sea, because they need [[light]] to survive.
