# a verb form indicating that an action or state has been completed at the present time, in the past, or will be completed in the future.  English has three perfect tenses:

:*[[present perfect]]

In addition to the regular perfect tenses, English can create other variations with various other auxiliary verbs.  The verb phrase in the main clause of the first example could be called a '''conditional perfect''' tense:

: ''"He would have ridden his bicycle if it had not rained."''
: ''"She was about to have gone home."'' - ''"She was going to have gone home."''
: ''"They had been going for a swim every Thursday."''
