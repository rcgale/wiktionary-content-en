====Translations====
<!--(The following note need not apply: just give the word for a *generic* sausage in each language.  English has "chipolata", "saveloy", "Cumberland sausage", etc, but the generic term is "sausage", just as the generic term is "salchicha" in Spanish.)
Translations are complicated by the many names for different types of sausages in different languages. Thus the Spanish translation for different types of sausage may be ''salchicha f, chorizo m, butifarra f'', etc.
