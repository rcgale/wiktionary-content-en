Etymologically, the term Khuz signifies sugar cane. It is likely an Elamite derivation. The province of Khuzestan-meaning land or place of sugar cane- in modern Iran takes its name from this term. Khuzestan is today still a major sugar cane producer, especially in the city of Haft Tapeh, located in northern Kuzestan.
