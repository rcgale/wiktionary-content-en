'''Khuz''' signifies sugar cane, according to its etymology. It is likely an [[Elamite]] derivation. The province of [[Khuzestan]], which means meaning land or place of sugar cane, in modern [[Iran]] takes its name from this term. Khuzestan is today still a major sugar cane producer, especially in the city of [[Haft Tapeh]], located in northern Kuzestan.
