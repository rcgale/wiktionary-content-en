'''Shidi''' (&#24107;&#24351;, Cantonese: Sidai) means junior fellow students in a Chinese martial art school. Shi means teacher. Di means younger brother.  The seniority is not based on the student's age or level of skill, but on the chronological order of following a particular [[shifu]].  The master's first student is always the most senior [[Shixiong]].  The less senior students are called shidi among their peers.
