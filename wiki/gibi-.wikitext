The SI prefix meaning 2^30 (1 073 741 824). Compare to ''giga'', meaning 10^9 (1 000 000 000).

Not yet in widespread use, the binary multiple prefixes were established to make communication about computer systems, which by nature operate using numbers in base 2, more clear.

Hopefully computer hardware manufacturers will adopt these new prefixes; I recently bought a hard disk with an advertised capacity of 120 Gigabytes, but my operating system recognized only 113 Gigabytes. (The OS should measure memory in terms of the binary multiples, not the decimal multiples.) This is a communication problem that has potentially very bad effects.
