===Quotation===
*'''2004''': The end of the losing arrived in a Yankee game against Oakland, when the Pinstripes, down by 8-4 in the eighth inning, were granted a succession of feeble singles, nubbed infield '''squigglers''', three walks, and a two-run double, good for six runs and, in time, the win. &mdash; ''The New Yorker,'' 10 May 2004
