A [http://www.crimsonbird.com/lifestyles/laurino.htm review] of ''Were You Always an Italian?'' by Maria Laurino, ISBN 0393049302 says that "By the time you finish the book, you will know, when you want to insult someone in Italian, whether the word stunod or gabbadotz is more appropriate to the situation, and you will know whether you are pronouncing the word with the northern or southern dialect."
