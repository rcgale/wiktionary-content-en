'''[[na]] [[zdravie]]''' ''lit. for health, idiomatically, to your health''
# [[Cheers]], said before sharing a drink.
# [[Gesundheit]], said after someone [[sneeze|sneezes]].

==== Responses ====
: When sharing a drink, everyone says '''na zdravie'''. No response is required. Sometimes, however, people reply with ''[[nech slúži]]'' which means ''let it (i.e., health) serve (us)''.

: When said to someone who has sneezed, the proper response is ''[[ďakujem]]'' which means ''thank you''.
