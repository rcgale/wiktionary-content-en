English
{sheet-hows}

Australian colloquial term meaning 'of poor quality'.
Unlike some conjoined words, this term does not imply a collaboration of the two terms, [[shit]] and house. Shit is used to imply the shitness, and the house is to emphasise the large and enclosed nature of the shitness.

Used in situations of disgust, hatred or badness.

Synonyms- ([[fuck]]ed, [[shit]], piece of shit, [[crap]], [[bad]]ness)
