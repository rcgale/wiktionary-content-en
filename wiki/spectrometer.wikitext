A spectrometer is a measuring instrument that can measure spectra. It is most commonly used to denote the measuring apparatus to measure light spectra, i.e. to measure the intensities of light of various wavelengths. Attached to a telescope for instance, the spectrometer (or spectroscope) allows the determination of the chemistry of distant objects.

A mass spectrometer is a special kind of spectrometer, that measures relative abundances of masses. The mass spectrum is obtained through deflecting ions into a thin slit (using a magnet) and measuring the ion current with an electrometer.
