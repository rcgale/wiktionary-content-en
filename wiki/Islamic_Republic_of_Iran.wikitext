	    <p><b>Persia</b> is the historical and alternative name for the state of <a href="/wiki/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a> in the
European languages. The name was used in the West due to the ancient Greek name for Iran, <i>Persis</i>. Persia is used to
describe the nation of Iran, its people, or its ancient empire. Iranians themselves have always, from the earliest times till
today, called their country Iran.</p>
<p>The name <i>Persia</i> comes from a province in the south of Iran, called <i><a href="/wiki/Fars" title="Fars">Fars</a></i> in
the modern <a href="/wiki/Persian_language" title="Persian language">Persian language</a> and <i>Pars</i> in <a href=
"/wiki/Middle_Persian" title="Middle Persian">Middle Persian</a>. <i>Persis</i> is the <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" title=
"Greek language">Hellenized</a> form of Pars, based on which other European nations termed it <i>Persia</i>. This province was
the core of the original Persian Empire. Westerners referred to the state as Persia until <a href="/wiki/March_21" title=
"March 21">March 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1935" title="1935">1935</a>, when <a href="/wiki/Reza_Shah_Pahlavi" title=
"Reza Shah Pahlavi">Reza Shah Pahlavi</a> formally asked the international community to call the country by its native name,
<a href="/wiki/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a>, which means the country of <a href="/wiki/Aryan" title="Aryan">Aryans</a>. For the
geography of Fars/Persia, see <a href="/wiki/Geography_of_Iran" title="Geography of Iran">Geography of Iran</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Persians" title="Persians">Persians</a> are also an ethnic group. Persians are descended from the <a href=
"/wiki/Aryan" title="Aryan">Aryans</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Indo-European" title="Indo-European">Indo-European</a> people that
migrated to the region of Fars from Central Asia c. 1000 BC. Their language is called <a href="/wiki/Persian_language" title=
"Persian language">Persian</a>. According to the <a href="/wiki/2004" title="2004">2004</a> <a href="/wiki/CIA_World_Factbook"
title="CIA World Factbook">CIA World Factbook</a>, 51% of Iran's current population is ethnic Persians. Other estimations, based
on recent data and research, put the figure as high as 70% for ethnic Persians. Persian-speakers are in majority in <a href=
"/wiki/Afghanistan" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tajikstan" title="Tajikstan">Tajikstan</a>, and form a
large minority in <a href="/wiki/Uzbekistan" title="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>. Many other ethnic groups are represented in Iran,
including the the linguistically Turkicised Aryan group, the <a href="/wiki/Azerbaijani" title="Azerbaijani">Azerbaijanis</a>,
Iranian <a href="/wiki/Kurd" title="Kurd">Kurds</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Turkmen_people" title="Turkmen people">Turkmens</a>; and
a few <a href="/wiki/Arab" title="Arab">Arabs</a> and other minorities. See <a href="/wiki/Demographics_of_Iran" title=
"Demographics of Iran">Demographics of Iran</a> for more detail.</p>
<p>As an empire and civilization, Persia began in the 7th century BC with the rise of the <a href="/wiki/Achaemenid_dynasty"
title="Achaemenid dynasty">Achaemenid dynasty</a> and has endured to the present day. This civilization was established by ethnic
Persians but very soon spread to other groups by force and by cultural diffusion. Persian culture is one of the cultures with the
longest historical continuity. <a href="/wiki/Persian_language" title="Persian language">Persian language</a> itself is also one
of the earliest documented languages and was one of the first languages to form a standard written version.</p>
<p>A Persian monarch was called a <a href="/wiki/Shah" title="Shah">Shah</a>. See <a href="/wiki/List_of_kings_of_Persia" title=

<p>The first record of the Persians comes from an <a href="/wiki/Assyria" title="Assyria">Assyrian</a> inscription from the 800s
BC which calls them the <i>Parsu</i> and mentions them alongside another Aryan group, the <i>Madai</i> (<a href="/wiki/Mede"
title="Mede">Medes</a>). For the next two centuries the Persians and Medes were tributary peoples to Assyria, <a href=
"/wiki/Babylonia" title="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>, and another Aryan tribe, the <a href="/wiki/Scythian" title=
"Scythian">Scythians</a>. Eventually the Medes came to rule an independent Median Empire, and the Persians were subject to
them.</p>
<p>The <b><a href="/wiki/Achaemenid_dynasty" title="Achaemenid dynasty">Achaemenid dynasty</a></b> was the first line of Persian
rulers, founded by <a href="/wiki/Achaemenes" title="Achaemenes">Achaemenes</a>, chieftain of the Persians around 700 BC. His son
Teispes led the nomadic Persians to settle in southern Iran around 650 BC, establishing the first organized Persian <a href=
"/wiki/State" title="State">state</a>. The Persians gradually conquered territory from the native kingdom of <a href="/wiki/Elam"
title="Elam">Elam</a>, including the important region of <a href="/wiki/Anshan" title="Anshan">Anshan</a>. Teispes' descendants
branched off into two lines, one line ruling in Anshan, while the other ruled the rest of Persia.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Cyrus_II_the_Great" title="Cyrus II the Great">Cyrus II the Great</a> united the divided kingdoms around
<a href="/wiki/559_BC" title="559 BC">559 BC</a>. At this time the Persians were still subservient to the <a href="/wiki/Medes"
title="Medes">Median Empire</a> ruled by Cyrus' grandfather, Astyages. Cyrus rallied the Persians together and revolted, throwing
Astyages from power. Cyrus, now <a href="/wiki/Shah" title="Shah">Shah</a> of a united Persian kingdom, conquered the rest of
Media and their large Middle Eastern empire in <a href="/wiki/550_BC" title="550 BC">550 BC</a>. Cyrus led the united Medes and
Persians to still more conquest. He took <a href="/wiki/Lydia" title="Lydia">Lydia</a> in Asia Minor and carried his arms
eastward into central Asia. Finally in <a href="/wiki/539_BC" title="539 BC">539 BC</a>, Cyrus marched triumphantly into the
ancient city of <a href="/wiki/Babylon" title="Babylon">Babylon</a>. After this victory, he set the standard of the benevolent
conqueror by declaring what has been called the <a href="/wiki/Cyrus_Charter_of_Human_Rights" title=
"Cyrus Charter of Human Rights">Cyrus Charter of Human Rights</a>. In this charter, the king promised not to terrorize Babylon or
destroy its institutions and culture. Cyrus was killed during a battle against the <a href="/wiki/Massagetae" title=
"Massagetae">Massagetae</a> or <a href="/wiki/Sakas" title="Sakas">Sakas</a>.</p>
<p>Cyrus' son, <a href="/wiki/Cambyses_II" title="Cambyses II">Cambyses II</a>, added <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title=
"Egypt">Egypt</a> to the Persian Empire. The empire then reached its greatest extent under <a href="/wiki/Darius_I_of_Persia"
title="Darius I of Persia">Darius I</a>. He led conquering armies into the <a href="/wiki/Indus_River" title="Indus River">Indus
River</a> valley and into <a href="/wiki/Thrace" title="Thrace">Thrace</a> in Europe. His invasion of <a href="/wiki/Greece"
title="Greece">Greece</a> was halted at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Marathon" title="Battle of Marathon">Battle of Marathon</a>.
His son <a href="/wiki/Xerxes_I" title="Xerxes I">Xerxes I</a> also tried to conquer Greece, but was defeated at the naval
<a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Salamis" title="Battle of Salamis">battle of Salamis</a> in 480 BC.</p>
<p>The Achaemenid Persian Empire was the largest and most powerful empire the world had yet seen. More importantly, it was well
managed and organized. Darius divided his realm into about twenty provinces under <a href="/wiki/Satrap" title=
"Satrap">satraps</a>, or governors, many of whom had personal ties to the Shah. He instituted a system of tribute to tax each
province. He took the advanced postal system of the Assyrians and expanded it. Also taken from the Assyrians was the usage of
secret agents of the king, known as the <a href="/w/index.php?title=King%27s_Eyes_and_Ears&amp;action=edit" class="new" title=
"King's Eyes and Ears">King's Eyes and Ears</a>, keeping him informed. He built the famous <a href=
"/w/index.php?title=Royal_Road&amp;action=edit" class="new" title="Royal Road">Royal Road</a> by improving ancient trade routes,
thereby connecting far reaches of the empire. He moved the administration center from Persia itself to <a href="/wiki/Susa"
title="Susa">Susa</a>, near Babylon and closer to the center of the realm. The Persians allowed local cultures to survive,
following the precedent set by Cyrus the Great. This was not only good for the empire's subjects, but ultimately benefited the
Achaemenids, since the conquered peoples felt no need to revolt.</p>
<p>During the Achaemenid period, <a href="/wiki/Zoroastrianism" title="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a> became the religion of
the rulers and most of the people of Persia. Its founder <a href="/wiki/Zoroaster" title="Zoroaster">Zoroaster</a> had lived
around 600 BC. The new religion was a new look at the traditional Aryan gods; it emphasized a universal struggle between good and
evil gods and a final battle yet to come. Zoroastrianism and its mystic leaders, called <a href="/wiki/Magi" title=
"Magi">Magi</a>, would become a defining element of Persian culture.</p>
<p>Achaemenid Persia united people and kingdoms from every major civilization of the time except China. For the first time people
from very different cultures were in contact with each other under one ruler. It was without a doubt the largest and most
powerful empire the world had ever seen.</p>

<p>The later years of the Achaemenid dynasty were marked by decay and decadence. The mightiest empire in the world collapsed in
only eight years when it fell under the attack of a young <a href="/wiki/Macedon" title="Macedon">Macedonian</a> king,
<b><a href="/wiki/Alexander_the_Great" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a></b>.</p>
<p>Persia's weakness was exposed to the Greeks in 401 BC, when the <a href="/wiki/Satrap" title="Satrap">Satrap</a> of <a href=
"/wiki/Sardis" title="Sardis">Sardis</a> hired ten thousand Greek mercenaries to help secure his claim to the imperial throne
(see <a href="/wiki/Xenophon" title="Xenophon">Xenophon</a>). This exposed both the political instability and military weakness
of late Achaemenid Persia.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Philip_II_of_Macedon" title="Philip II of Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a>, leader of most of Greece, and his
son Alexander decided to take advantage of this weakness. After Philip's death, Alexander looked toward Persia. Alexander's army
landed in Asia Minor in <a href="/wiki/334_BC" title="334 BC">334 BC</a>. His armies quickly swept through Lydia, Phoenecia, and
Egypt, before defeating all the troops of <a href="/wiki/Darius_III" title="Darius III">Darius III</a> and capturing the capital
at Susa. The last Achaemenid resistance was at the "Persian Gates" near the royal palace at Persepolis. The Persian Empire was
now in Greek hands.</p>
<p>Along his route of conquest, Alexander founded many colony cities, all named "Alexandria." For the next several centuries,
these cities served to greatly extend Greek, or <a href="/wiki/Hellenistic" title="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a>, culture in
Persia.</p>
<p>Alexander's empire broke up shortly after his death, but Persia remained in Greek hands. Alexander's general, <a href=
"/wiki/Seleucus" title="Seleucus">Seleucus</a>, took control of Persia, Mesopotamia, and later Syria and Asia Minor. His ruling
family is known as the <b><a href="/wiki/Seleucid_Dynasty" title="Seleucid Dynasty">Seleucid Dynasty</a></b>.</p>
<p>Greek colonization continued until around 250 BC; Greek language, philosophy, and art came with the colonists. Throughout
Alexander's former empire, Greek became the common tongue of diplomacy and literature. Trade with <a href="/wiki/China" title=
"China">China</a> had begun in Achaemenid times along the so-called <a href="/wiki/Silk_Road" title="Silk Road">Silk Road</a>;
but during the Hellenistic period it began in earnest. The overland trade brought about some fascinating cultural exchanges.
<a href="/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> came in from India, while Zoroastrianism traveled west to influence
<a href="/wiki/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>. Incredible statues of the <a href="/wiki/Buddha" title="Buddha">Buddha</a>
in classical Greek styles have been found in Persia and Afghanistan, illustrating the mix of cultures that occurred around this
time (See <a href="/wiki/Greco-Buddhism" title="Greco-Buddhism">Greco-Buddhism</a>), although it is possible that Greco-Buddhist
art dates from Achaemenid times when Greek artists worked for the Persians.</p>
<p>The Seleucid kingdom began to decline rather quickly. Even during Seleucus' lifetime the capital was moved from <a href=
"/wiki/Seleucia" title="Seleucia">Seleucia</a> in Mesopotamia to the more Mediterranean-oriented <a href="/wiki/Antioch" title=
"Antioch">Antioch</a> in Syria. The eastern provinces of <a href="/wiki/Bactria" title="Bactria">Bactria</a> and <a href=
"/wiki/Parthia" title="Parthia">Parthia</a> broke off from the Seleucid Kingdom in 238 BC. King <a href="/wiki/Antiochus_III"
title="Antiochus III">Antiochus III</a>'s military leadership kept Parthia from overrunning Persia itself, but his successes
alarmed the burgeoning <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>. Roman legions began to attack the
kingdom. At the same time, the Seleucids had to contend with the revolt of the <a href="/wiki/Maccabees" title=
"Maccabees">Maccabees</a> in Judea and the expansion of the <a href="/wiki/Kushan" title="Kushan">Kushan</a> Empire to the east.
The empire fell apart and was conquered by Parthia.</p>

<h2>Parthian Persia</h2>

<p><b><a href="/wiki/Parthian_Empire" title="Parthian Empire">Parthia</a></b> was a region north of Persia in what is today
northeastern Iran. Its rulers, the <a href="/wiki/Arsacid_dynasty" title="Arsacid dynasty">Arsacid dynasty</a>, belonged to an
Iranian tribe that had settled there during the time of Alexander. They declared their independence from the Seleucids in 238 BC,
but their attempts to expand into Persia were thwarted until c. <a href="/wiki/170_BC" title="170 BC">170 BC</a> under <a href=
"/wiki/Mithridates_I" title="Mithridates I">Mithridates I</a>.</p>
<p>The Parthian Empire shared a border with Rome along the upper Euphrates River. The two empires became major rivals. Parthian
mounted archers proved a match for Roman legions. Wars were very frequent, with <a href="/wiki/Mesopotamia" title=
"Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> serving as the battleground.</p>
<p>During the Parthian period, Hellenistic customs partially gave way to a resurgence of Persian culture. However, the empire
lacked political unity. By the first century BC, Parthia was decentralized, ruled by <a href="/wiki/Feudal" title=
"Feudal">feudal</a> nobles. Wars with Rome to the west and the <a href="/wiki/Kushan" title="Kushan">Kushan</a> Empire to the
northeast drained the country's resources.</p>

<h2>Sassanian Persia</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/226" title="226">226</a>-<a href="/wiki/650" title="650">650</a></p>
<p>During Parthian rule Persia was only one province in a large, loosely controlled empire. The local king of Persia at this
time, <a href="/wiki/Ardashir_I" title="Ardashir I">Ardashir I</a>, led a revolt against the imperial government of Parthia. In
two years he was the <a href="/wiki/Shah" title="Shah">shah</a> of a new Persian Empire.</p>
<p>The <b><a href="/wiki/Sassanian_dynasty" title="Sassanian dynasty">Sassanian dynasty</a></b> (named for Ardashir's
grandfather) was the first native Persian ruling dynasty since the Achaemenids; thus they saw themselves as the successors of
Darius and Cyrus. They pursued an aggressive expansionist policy. They recovered much of the eastern lands that the Kushans had
taken in the Parthian period. The Sassanians continued to make war against Rome; a Persian army even captured the Emperor
<a href="/wiki/Valerian_%28emperor%29" title="Valerian (emperor)">Valerian</a> in 260.</p>
<p>Sassanian Persia, unlike Parthia, was a highly centralized state. The people were rigidly organized into a caste system:
Priests, Soldiers, Scribes, and Commoners. Zoroastrianism was finally made the official state religion and spread outside Persia
proper and out into the provinces. All other religions were persecuted.</p>
<p>The wars and religious control that had fueled Sassanian Persia's early successes eventually contributed to its decline. The
eastern regions were conquered by the <a href="/wiki/White_Huns" title="White Huns">White Huns</a> in the late 400s. Adherents of
a radical religious sect, the Mazdakites, revolted around the same time. <a href="/wiki/Khosrau_I_of_Persia" title=
"Khosrau I of Persia">Khosrau I</a> was able to recover his empire and expand into the Christian countries of <a href=
"/wiki/Antioch" title="Antioch">Antioch</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yemen" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>. However, a final war with Rome
utterly destroyed the empire. Between 605 and 629 CE, Sassanids successfully annexed Levant and Egypt and pushed into Anatolia.
Their armies even reached Constantinople, but could not defeat the Byzantines there. Emperor Heraclius successfully outflanked
Sassanid armies in Asia Minor and handed them a crushing defeat in Northern Mesopotamia. Sassanids had to give up all their
conquered lands and retreat. Heavy taxing and a very long war caused rebellions across the empire. Khosro II (Parviz) was
assassinated in 629 and the empire plunged into anarchy after the death of his successor, Kavadh II. After a defeat at Nineveh in
<a href="/wiki/642" title="642">642</a>, civil war broke out and the king was assassinated. The Sassanian shahs no longer had
control over the country.</p>

<h2>Islam and Persia</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/650" title="650">650</a>-<a href="/wiki/1219" title="1219">1219</a></p>
<p>Persia's conquest by <a href="/wiki/Islamic" title="Islamic">Islamic</a> <a href="/wiki/Arab" title="Arab">Arab</a> armies
marks the transition into "<a href="/wiki/Medieval" title="Medieval">medieval</a>" Persia. The explosive growth of the Arab
Caliphate coincided with the chaos caused by the end of Sassanian rule. Conquest came easily; most of the country was overrun in
643-650. The last resistance from the remnants of the Sassanian dynasty ended two years later.</p>
<p>The Arab empire, ruled by the <b><a href="/wiki/Umayyad_Dynasty" title="Umayyad Dynasty">Umayyad Dynasty</a></b>, was the
largest state in history up to that point. It stretched from Spain to the Indus, from the Aral Sea to the southern tip of Arabia.
The Umayyads borrowed from Persian and <a href="/wiki/Byzantine" title="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> administration systems and moved
their capital to <a href="/wiki/Damascus" title="Damascus">Damascus</a>, in the center of their empire. The Umayyads would rule
Persia for a hundred years.</p>
<p>Arab conquest completely changed life in Persia. <a href="/wiki/Arabic_language" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> became the
new common tongue. Islam quickly replaced Zoroastrianism; mosques were built, and many Persians intermarried with Arabs. An
entirely new language, religion, and culture were imposed on Persia.</p>
<p>In 750 the Umayyads were ousted from power by the <b><a href="/wiki/Abbasid" title="Abbasid">Abbasid</a></b> family. Their
rule ushered in a golden age of Islamic civilization. Persian literature spread throughout the Arab world, along with Greek
science and mathematics. It was a Persian, <a href="/wiki/Al-Khwarizmi" title="Al-Khwarizmi">al-Khwarizmi</a>, who first devised
<a href="/wiki/Algebra" title="Algebra">algebra</a> in 810. The poet <a href="/wiki/Firdawsi" title="Firdawsi">Firdawsi</a> wrote
<i>Shah Nama,</i> an epic poem telling the history of the Persian kings, in 1008.</p>
<p>But political unrest continued. In 819, East-Persia was conquered by the Persian <b><a href="/wiki/Samanid" title=
"Samanid">Samanids</a></b>, the first native rulers after the Arabic conquest. They made <a href="/wiki/Samarqand" title=
"Samarqand">Samarqand</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bukhara" title="Bukhara">Bukhara</a> and <a href="/wiki/Herat" title="Herat">Herat</a>
their capitals and revived the <a href="/wiki/Persian_language" title="Persian language">Persian language</a> and culture. In
913, West-Persia was conquered by the <b><a href="/wiki/Buwayhid" title="Buwayhid">Buwayhid</a></b>, a native Persian tribal
confederation from the shores of the Caspian Sea. They made the Persian city of <a href="/wiki/Shiraz%2C_Iran" title=
"Shiraz, Iran">Shiraz</a> their capital. The Buwayids destroyed Islam's former territorial unity. Rather than a province of a
united Muslim empire, Persia became one nation in an increasingly diverse and cultured Islamic world.</p>
<p>The Muslim world was shaken again in 1037 with the invasion of the <b><a href="/wiki/Seljuk_Turks" title="Seljuk Turks">Seljuk
Turks</a></b> from the northeast. The Seljuks created a very large Middle Eastern empire and continued in the flowering of
medieval Islamic culture. The Seljuks built the fabulous Friday Mosque in the city of <a href="/wiki/Isfahan" title=
"Isfahan">Isfahan</a>. The most famous Persian writer of all time, <a href="/wiki/Omar_Khayyam" title="Omar Khayyam">Omar
Khayyam</a>, wrote his <i>Rubayat</i> of love poetry during Seljuk times.</p>
<p>In the early 1200s the Seljuks lost control of Persia to another group of <a href="/wiki/Turks" title="Turks">Turks</a> from

<p>In 1218, Genghis Khan sent ambassadors and merchants to the city of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Otrar&amp;action=edit" class=
"new" title="Otrar">Otrar</a>, on the northeastern confines of the Khwarizm shahdom. The governor of Otrar had these envoys
executed. Genghis, out of revenge, sacked Otrar in 1219 and continued on to <a href="/wiki/Samarkand" title=
"Samarkand">Samarkand</a> and other cities of the northeast.</p>
<p>Genghis' grandson, <a href="/wiki/Hulagu_Khan" title="Hulagu Khan">Hulagu Khan</a>, finished what Genghis had begun when he
conquered Persia, Baghdad, and much of the rest of the Middle East in 1255-1258. Persia became the <b><a href="/wiki/Ilkhanate"
title="Ilkhanate">Ilkhanate</a></b>, a division of the vast <a href="/wiki/Mongol_Empire" title="Mongol Empire">Mongol
Empire</a>.</p>
<p>In 1295, after Ilkhan Ghazan converted to Islam, he renounced all allegiance to the Great Khan. The Ilkhans patronized the
arts and learning in the fine tradition of Persian Islam; indeed, they helped to repair much of the damage of the Mongol
conquests.</p>
<p>In 1335, the last Ilkhan's death spelled the end of the Ilkhanate. It splintered into a number of small states. This left
Persia open to still more conquest at the hands of another Mongol, <b><a href="/wiki/Timur_the_Lame" title="Timur the Lame">Timur
the Lame</a></b> or Tamerlane. He invaded Persia beginning around 1370 and plundered the country until his death in 1405. Timur
was an even bloodier conqueror than Genghis had been. In <a href="/wiki/Isfahan" title="Isfahan">Isfahan</a>, for instance, he
slaughtered 70,000 people so that he could build towers with their skulls. He conquered a wide area and made his own city of
Samarkand rich, but he made no effort to forge a lasting empire. Persia was essentially left in ruins.</p>
<p>For the next hundred years Persia was not a unified state. It was ruled for a while by descendants of Timur, called the
<a href="/wiki/Timurid_Empire" title="Timurid Empire">Timurid</a> <a href="/wiki/Emirs" title="Emirs">emirs</a>. Toward the end
of the 1400s Persia was taken over by the Emirate of the <b><a href="/wiki/White_Sheep_Turkmen" title="White Sheep Turkmen">White
Sheep Turkmen</a></b> (<i>Ak Koyunlu</i>). But there was little unity and none of the sophistication that had defined Persia
during the glory days of Islam.</p>

<h2>A new Persian empire: the Safavids</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/1500" title="1500">1500</a>-<a href="/wiki/1722" title="1722">1722</a></p>
<p>The <b><a href="/wiki/Safavid_Dynasty" title="Safavid Dynasty">Safavid Dynasty</a></b> hailed from <a href="/wiki/Azerbaijan"
title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, at that time considered a part of the greater Persia region. The Safavid Shah <a href=
"/wiki/Ismail_I" title="Ismail I">Ismail I</a> overthrew the White Sheep Turkish rulers of Persia to found a new Persian empire.
Ismail expanded Persia to include all of present-day Azerbaijan, Iran, and Iraq, plus much of <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan" title=
"Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. Ismail's expansion was halted by the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman
Empire</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Chaldiran" title="Battle of Chaldiran">Battle of Chaldiran</a> in <a href="/wiki/1514"
title="1514">1514</a>, and war with the Ottomans became a fact of life in Safavid Persia.</p>
<p>Safavid Persia was a violent and chaotic state for the next seventy years, but in 1588 Shah <a href="/wiki/Abbas_the_Great"
title="Abbas the Great">Abbas the Great</a> ascended to the throne and instituted a cultural and political renaissance. He moved
his capital to Isfahan, which quickly became one of the most important cultural centers in the Islamic world. He made peace with
the Ottomans. He reformed the army, drove the <a href="/wiki/Uzbeks" title="Uzbeks">Uzbeks</a> out of Persia and into modern-day
<a href="/wiki/Uzbekistan" title="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>, and captured a <a href="/wiki/Portugal" title=
"Portugal">Portuguese</a> base on the island of <a href="/wiki/Ormus" title="Ormus">Ormus</a>.</p>
<p>The Safavids were followers of <a href="/wiki/Shi%27a" title="Shi'a">Shi'a</a> Islam, and under them Persia became the largest
Shi'ite country in the Muslim world, a position Iran still holds today.</p>
<p>Under the Safavids Persia enjoyed its last period as a major imperial power. In the early 1600s, a final border was agreed
upon with Ottoman Turkey; it still forms the border between <a href="/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> and Iran today.</p>

<h2>Persia and Europe</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/1722" title="1722">1722</a>-<a href="/wiki/1935" title="1935">1935</a></p>
<p>In 1722 Safavid Persia collapsed. That year saw the first European invasion of Persia since the time of Alexander: <a href=
"/wiki/Peter_the_Great" title="Peter the Great">Peter the Great</a>, <a href="/wiki/Czar" title="Czar">Czar</a> of <a href=
"/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>, invaded from the northwest as part of a bid to dominate central Asia. To make the
situation truly hopeless, Ottoman forces accompanied the Russians, successfully laying siege to Isfahan.</p>
<p>The country was able to weather the invasions; neither the Russians nor the Turks gained any territory. However, the Safavids
were severely weakened, and that same year (1722), the empire's <a href="/wiki/Pashtun" title="Pashtun">Afghani</a> subjects
launched a bloody revolt in response to the Safavids' attempts to convert them from <a href="/wiki/Sunni" title="Sunni">Sunni</a>
to Shi'a Islam. The last Safavid shah was executed and the dynasty came to an end.</p>
<p>The Persian empire experienced a temporary revival under <b><a href="/wiki/Nadir_Shah" title="Nadir Shah">Nadir Shah</a></b>
in the 1730s and '40s. Nadir drove out the Russians and confined the Afghans to their present home in Afghanistan. He launched
many successful campaigns against Persia's old enemies, the nomadic khanates of Central Asia; most of them were destroyed or
absorbed into Persia. However, his empire declined after his death. His rule was followed by the weak and short-lived <b><a href=
"/wiki/Zand_dynasty" title="Zand dynasty">Zand dynasty</a></b>. Persia was left unprepared for the worldwide expansion of
European empires in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>
<p>Persia found stability in the <b><a href="/wiki/Qajar_dynasty" title="Qajar dynasty">Qajar dynasty</a></b>, ruling from 1779
to 1925, but by this time the country could not hope to compete with the new industrial powers of Europe. Persia found itself
sandwiched between the growing Russian Empire in <a href="/wiki/Central_Asia" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a> and the
expanding <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> in <a href="/wiki/India" title=
"India">India</a>.</p>
<p>Although Persia was never directly invaded, it was made economically dependent on Europe. Britain and Russia each created a
<a href="/wiki/Sphere_of_influence" title="Sphere of influence">sphere of influence</a> in which the colonial power had the final
say on economic matters. So, when the first Middle Eastern oil strike was made in 1908 at <a href="/wiki/Masjid-al-Salaman"
title="Masjid-al-Salaman">Masjid-al-Salaman</a> in southwest Persia, Britain quickly took up the rights to the oil finds. Persian
oil became one of the major commodities to flow into Britain.</p>
<p>After <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Revolution" title=
"Russian Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>, Britain claimed Persia as a <a href="/wiki/Protectorate" title=
"Protectorate">protectorate</a> and took tighter control over the increasingly lucrative oilfields. In <a href="/wiki/1925"
title="1925">1925</a>, <a href="/wiki/Reza_Shah_Pahlavi" title="Reza Shah Pahlavi">Reza Shah Pahlavi</a> seized power from the
Qajars and established the new <b><a href="/wiki/Pahlavi_dynasty" title="Pahlavi dynasty">Pahlavi dynasty</a></b>. However,
Britain and the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> continued to be the economic powers in Persia
into the early years of the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>.</p>
<p>By the 1930s Persia was not the world power it had once been; it was a weapon in the political battles of the West. When the
Pahlavi Shah asked the world to call the country Iran in <a href="/wiki/1935" title="1935">1935</a>, in a way he symbolically
bade farewell to the mighty empire of ancient times.</p>
