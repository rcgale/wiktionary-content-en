Co-branding is a rising phenomenon, also called dual branding. Co-branding involves two or more well-known brands being combined in an offer, e.g. Starbucks and Pepsico. The arrangement is based on symbiosis. Each brand sponsor expects that the other brand name will strengthen preference or purchase intentions (Kotler on Marketing/11e/Prentice-Hall, p. 434). In case of co-packaged products, each brand hopes it might be reaching a new audience by associating the other brand.
