'''Homeorhesis''', derived from the [[Greek]] for "similar flow", is a concept encompassing dynamical systems which return to a trajectory, as opposed to systems which return to a particular state, which is termed [[homeostasis]]. The word itself is a little-used [[term of art]] in biology, where it describes the tendency of developing orchanging organisms to continue development or change towards a given state, even if disturbed in development. The term was first coined by [[C.H. Waddington]], on or before [[1940]], along with the related term [[chreod]], meaning "necessary path", which is the trajectory to which the system tends to return. In [[ecology]] the concept is important as an element of the [[Gaia theory]], where they system considered to is the ecological balance of different forms of life on the planet.
