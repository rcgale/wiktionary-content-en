'''Mondayitis''' is a [[neologism]] used in pop culture to describe the tired and apathetic feeling many experience upon the return to work after the weekend. '''Mondayitis''' is the same as '''having a case of the Mondays'''. A possible reason for Mondayitis is that human [[circadian rhythm]]s are incompatible with the normal [[Working time|40-hour working week]].
