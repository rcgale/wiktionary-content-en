Curtainwall or storm shutters are usually removable protections for all windows and doors in a residence or building against the effects of high winds, rain and flying objects during a hurricane. They can be made of a variety of materials such as aluminum panels, iron or even wood. Some are installed permanently and have a way of being opened or closed relatively quickly.
