Instant coffee manufacturing: the coffee beans are roasted, ground and the soluble particles are "washed out", extracted with hot water. The hotter the water the more soluble particles will be extracted. The left overs, the spent coffee grounds, are dried and either burnt or deposed off. The second step is to remove the water of the coffee extract first in an evaporator and finally in a spray drier or a freeze drying plant. Different aromatisation processes help to recover and to prevent volatile aromes beeing lost in the thermal processes. No additions are allowed, for the extraction only water is permitted.
The instant coffee manufacturing process is similar to the production of sugar out of beets and herbal pharmaceutics: extraction, evaporation, drying, conditioning, packing.
