An '''epigone''' is less-distinguished [[imitation|imitator]] or follower, of a pioneering [[artist]] or [[philosopher]].

The word came into [[English language|English]] via [[French language|French]] '' &eacute;pigones'', tracing to [[Greek language|Greek]] ''&epsilon;&pi;&iota;&gamma;&omega;&nu;&omega;&iota;'' (''epigonoi'') meaning "those born afterwards".  Deeper, it traces to Greek ''&epsilon;&pi;&iota;&gamma;&omega;&nu;&omega;&sigma;'' (''epigonos''), of the offspring of the [[Seven Against Thebes|seven heroes against Thebes]], from ''&epsilon;&pi;&iota;&gamma;&iota;&gamma;&nu;&epsilon;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&iota;'' (''epigignesthai''), meaning ''to be born after'', from ''&epsilon;&pi;&iota;'' (''epi'')- meaning ''upon'', after + ''&gamma;&iota;&gamma;&nu;&epsilon;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&iota;'' (''gignesthai''), meaning ''to be born''. 

The [[adjective]] ''epigonic'' has the same root.

One example from ''[[History of crime fiction]]'',
