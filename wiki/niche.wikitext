The only standard pronunciation in dictionaries that I've found for "niche" has the word rhyme with "rich."  However, over the past few years I have repeatedly heard on radio & television, mostly on news broadcasts such as THE NEWS HOUR & NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT on PBS & on NPR's MORNING EDITION, a pronunciation that rhymes with "quiche."  When did this begin & why?
