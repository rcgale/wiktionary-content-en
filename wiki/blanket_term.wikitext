A '''blanket term''' is a [[Morpheme|word]] or [[phrase]] that is used to describe multiple groups of related things. The degree of relation may vary. Blanket terms often trade specificity for ease-of-use; in other words, a blanket term by itself gives little detail about the things that it describes or the relationships between them, but is easy to say and remember. Blanket terms often originate as [[slang]], and eventually become integrated into the general vocabulary.

==Examples==
*Racial groupings such as [[Whites|White]], [[Asian]], and [[Black#Human|Black]]
*[[Personal computer]], [[IBM PC]], or [[IBM PC compatible]], for any [[computer]] modeled upon the [[x86]] architechure
*[[Car]], for [[automobiles]], [[truck]]s, and similar vehicles.
