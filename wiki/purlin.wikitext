Horizontal structural member bridging two or more rafters.

Note that horizontal beams bridging wall posts are not purlins, see [[girt]].

In the USA, a roof composed of wooden shakes nailed to purlins is said to be "skip sheathed", in contrast to asphalt and composition roofs which use continuous plywood sheathing for underlayment.
