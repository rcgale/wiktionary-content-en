===Verb===
'''knap'''
#To shape a [[hard]], [[brittle]] material (usually [[flint]] or [[obsidian]]) by breaking away sections, often forming a sharp [[edge]] or [[point]].  Distinguished from "[[carve]]" by the fact that each [[fracture]] goes through the entire work piece, and from "[[cleave]]" by curved or [[conchoid]] fractures (due to the work piece not being a single [[crystal]]).
