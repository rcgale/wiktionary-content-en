''frenchified''

# To have [[become]] more like the [[French]].

Most people are aware of the second [[definition]] of this [[adjective]], but not the first. One really must give [[credit]] for this word where credit is due; namely to the [[English]] and their [[peculiar]] blend of humor, [[disdain]], and good old-fashioned [[xenophobia]].
