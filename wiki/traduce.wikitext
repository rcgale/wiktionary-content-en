==Other languages==
Note that in some other languages, in particular Romance languages, the word that sounds most like "traduce" actually means "translate". E.g., Spanish traducir, Italian tradurre. These words all have the same origin, but the meaning has changed in English.  Words which look similar in different languages, but actually have different meanings, are sometimes called "[[false friend]]s". The correct Spanish translation of "traduce" is "calumniar".
