A '''catfight''' is, by literal definition, a physical clash between two [[cat]]s. 

More often, the term 'catfight' is used as a [[slang]] term for a physical altercation between two women, usually young adults or teenagers.  It is [[stereotype]]d as involving slapping, scratching, and sometimes biting as opposed to punching or kicking.  Many catfights in [[cartoon]]s, [[film|movies]], and [[beer]] commercials end with at least one of the participants missing several articles of clothing.  Catfighting is also a popular subject amongst [[pornographic movie|pornographic films]] depicting multiple women in [[human sexuality|sexually]] suggestive and combative situations.

Catfighting is usually used as a derisive term by males to poke fun at the way women stereotypically fight.
