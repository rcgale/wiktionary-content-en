'''&#1488;''' (spelled ''[[aleph]]'') is the first letter of the [[Hebrew]] alphabet.

* '''Next''': [[&#1489;]]

&#1488; is the Primary, and also the first symbol, which begins to form the set of characters, which taken together, completely give rise, to the form of the holy [[Hebrew]] [[Aleph]]-[[Beit]]. The english word "[[alphabet]]" is derived from the pronunciation associated with the '''א''' or ''Aleph'', and the symbol of it's birth, the [[ב]] or ''Beit''.
