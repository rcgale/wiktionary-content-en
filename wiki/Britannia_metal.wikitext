'''Britannia Metal'''
18th and 19th Century Britannia Metal usually refers to an alloy of [[pewter]] that, after 1846, formed as a base metal for silver electrolysis. The composition was approximately 93% tin, 5 % antimony, and 2% copper. Its first mention, according to: ''The New Encyclopaedia Britannica, Micropaedia'' (2002, 15th edition), was in 1769 when it was referred to as "Vickers White Metal."

Some authorities and collectors think that it is this "[[white metal]]" that formed a base for early experimentations in [[mercury]] and tin or [[latten]] metal plating in the 18th and early 19th Centuries.
