[[繁]][[體]][[字]] (fántǐzì)
#'''Traditional Chinese''' characters are used in the Republic of China (Taiwan) and Hong-Kong; they have been replaced in the People's Republic of China by [[Simplified Chinese]] ([[简体字]]) .
In countries which borrowed Chinese writing (Japan, Korea etc.), characters resemble Traditional Chinese more than [[Simplified Chinese]].
