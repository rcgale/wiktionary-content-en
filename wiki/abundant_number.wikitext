Derivative of [[abundant]]
===Noun expression===
#''(Mathematics):'' a number, the sum of whose [[aliquot]] parts exceeds the number itself. Thus, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, the aliquot parts of 12, make the number 16. This is opposed to a [[deficient number]], as 14, whose aliquot parts are 1, 2, 7, the sum of which is 10; and to a [[perfect number]], which is equal to the sum of its aliquot parts, as 6, whose aliquot parts are 1, 2, 3.
