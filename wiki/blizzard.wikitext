==Etymology==
The earliest known use of the word ''blizard'' was in the [[W:Estherville, Iowa|Estherville, Iowa]], ''Northern Vindicator'' on 23 April 1870.  One week later it appeared again in the same newspaper, only with the now common double-z spelling.  Best evidence is that the word was coined in that area of Iowa some years prior to this use, though the source of the term has not been established.
