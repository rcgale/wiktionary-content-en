===Etymology===
''Origins Unknown''. Possibly from ''blizard'', a [[surname]] dating back to the 1700's(?). The earliest known use of ''blizard'' as a term was in the [[W:Estherville, Iowa|Estherville, Iowa]], ''Northern Vindicator'' on 23 April 1870.  One week later it appeared again in the same newspaper, only with the now common double-z spelling.  Best evidence is that the word was coined in that area of Iowa some years prior to this use.

The ''blizard'' surname possibly comes from the ''bizard'' one, dating back to the 1500's(?).
