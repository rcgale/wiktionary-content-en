'''Pound-for-pound''' is the term used to describe a fighter's value in relation to fighters of equal weight. It was created to describe world [[welterweight]] and [[middleweight]] champion [[Sugar Ray Robinson]], the most accomplished fighter of the modern era, by supporters who realized that while he was the greatest, he could not beat the best heavyweights. Hence, Robinson was called the pound-for-pound best without being expected to best much larger fighters. [[Pernell Whitaker]], an [[Olympic]] [[gold medalist]] who won pro titles from 130-154 pounds, adopted the term to describe himself in the 1980s and '90s. Today, middleweight champion [[Bernard Hopkins]] is most commonly considered the best pound-for-pound, followed by titlists [[Floyd Mayweather]] and [[Antonio Tarver]].
