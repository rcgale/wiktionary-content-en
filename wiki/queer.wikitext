===Usage Note===
The use of this word to mean "homosexual" was formerly, and is often still, considered pejorative.  However, the word is also sometimes now used (primarily as adjective) as a neutral or even positive descriptive term, including by some homosexuals.  In its pejorative use, it is applied almost solely to males.  In its modern neutral use, it can be applied to both genders.
