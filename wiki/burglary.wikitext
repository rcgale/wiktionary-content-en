'''Burglary''' was defined under [[English Common law]] as: Breaking and entering the dwelling of another at night with intent to commit a [[felony]] or [[larceny]].

Modern law in the United States has largely refined that definition, removing many of the restrictions, such that it is breaking and entering any structure with intent to commit a felony or larceny.

For a modern example, see Texas Penal Code Section 30.02 at http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/statutes/pe/pe0003000.html#pe002.30.02

Note that Burglary is often used interchangeably with [[Breaking and Entering]]
