=== Etymology ===
While appearing as a single word in modern Western languages, the name actually consists of three [[Egypt|Egyptian]] words:
: '''twt''' &ndash; ''image''
: '''ankh''' &ndash; ''life''
: '''amon''' ''or'' '''amen''' ''or'' '''amun''' &ndash; ''the god Amon''

Hence, the meaning of the name: ''the living image of God''.

=== Alternate Spelling ===
* [[Tutankhamen]]
* [[Tutankhamun]]

We only ''know'' the letters ''mn'' of the last word in the name, as the Egyptians only wrote down [[consonant|consonants]] and no [[vowel|vowels]] in their writing system, so various people fill in various vowels.
=== Proper Noun ===
'''Tutankhamon'''
# Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] known for his young age, for the restoration of Egyptian religion, and for being the only Pharaoh whose [[tomb]] was preserved intact to the modern age.
