Forno means creamy peanut butter.

The word was first created in the Dark Ages in Europe some time ago; however, it did not mean what we now know it as yet.  As far as our researchs have been able to tell so far, forno was definetely the name of some type of food product in the Dark Ages.  

Forn would later fall out of style and language in Central and Southern Europe; fortunately, the word survived in small Northern tribes of Europeans that left to escape some land disputes and monetary debts.  The Northern European tribes may have intermixed with Vikings but it is hard to tell similarities between their language and our current one.  In these tribes, the word forno would evolve into a kind of creamy paste ground out of local substances.

The word might have been lost had it not been found in ancient records several years ago.  With much private research, scientists have been able to identify that the word forno did exist in Old English and had the definiton equivalent to that of our creamy peanut butter today.  
 
Many have spoken out about how the feel our English language needs to broaden its horizons and add new words.  Now, writers around the United States are one by one banning together to use bring the word forno back into modern dictionaries. 

Good luck, Forno.
