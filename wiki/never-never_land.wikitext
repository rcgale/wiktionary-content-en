The name '''Never Never Land''' often refers generally to a [[Fantasy|fantastic]] or [[Imagination|imaginary]] place - one is said to be "off in never never land" when one is coming up with completely impractical ideas, distracted, etc. "Going to Never Never Land" can also mean going to [[sleep]], or, more darkly, [[Death|dying]].

It is frequently mistakenly confused with [[Neverland]], a fictional island in [[J.M. Barrie]]'s ''[[Peter Pan]]''.

Compare also "the [[Never-Never]]" as a term referring to remoter parts of the [[Australia]]n [[outback]].
