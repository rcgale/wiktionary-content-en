'''Never Never Land''' is not the name of the world in which [[Peter Pan]] and his friends live in [[J.M. Barrie]]'s [[Peter Pan]]. However, it is frequently confused with [[Neverland]]. '''Never Never Land''' is often used to refer generally to a fantastic or imaginary place - one is said to be "off in never never land" when one is coming up with completely impractical ideas, distracted, etc.

Going to '''Never Never Land''' can also mean going to sleep, or, more darkly, dying.
