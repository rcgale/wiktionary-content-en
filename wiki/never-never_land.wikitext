'''Never Never Land''' is often used to refer generally to a fantastic or imaginary place - one is said to be "off in never never land" when one is coming up with completely impractical ideas, distracted, etc. It is frequently mistakenly confused with [[Neverland]], a fictional island in [[J.M. Barrie]]'s [[Peter Pan]].

Going to Never Never Land can also mean going to sleep, or, more darkly, dying.
