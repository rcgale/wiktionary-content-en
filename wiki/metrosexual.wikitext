==English==
===Etymology===
[[Blend]] of ''[[metro]]'', city, and ''[[heterosexual]]''.

Created by [http://www.marksimpson.com/pages/journalism/metrodaddyspeaks.html Mark Simpson] in July 2002 in [http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/2002/07/22/metrosexual/ an article] for the US based web site [http://www.salon.com/ Salon.com].

His own definition is "The typical metrosexual is a young man with money to spend, living in or within easy reach of a metropolis -- because that's where all the best shops, clubs, gyms and hairdressers are. He might be officially gay, straight or bisexual, but this is utterly immaterial because he has clearly taken himself as his own love object and pleasure as his sexual preference. Particular professions, such as modelling, waiting tables, media, pop music and, nowadays, sport, seem to attract them but, truth be told, like male vanity products and herpes, they're pretty much everywhere."
