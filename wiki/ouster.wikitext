==English==

===Noun===
'''ouster'''
#A putting out of possession; dispossession; ejection.
#The act of forcefully removing a politician from power.

'''Note''': Not used in British English, where the American usage above is often seen as ungrammatical. (It is felt the term should really refer to a person who [[ousts]]; compare [[dealer]], a person who [[deals]]).
