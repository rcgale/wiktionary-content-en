A '''letter carrier''' is an employee of the [[post office]] who delivers mail to a residence or business.  In the [[United States]], they drive distinctive white vans with the logo of the [[United States Postal Service]] on the side. The phrase "letter carrier" came to be used as a gender-neutral substitute for "mailman" soon after women began performing the job.
