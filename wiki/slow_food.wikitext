The Slow Food was founded by Carlo Petrini in Italy.

The movement preserves an ecoregion's cuisine and the associated food plants and seeds, domestic animals, and farming methods of that region. It was begun as a resistance movement to fast food but has expanded globally to 50 countries and now has 70,000 members. It now describes itself as an eco-gastronomy faction within the ecology movement, and some consider it also the culinary wing of the anti-globalization movement. It announced the opening of a new University of Food at Pollenzo, in Piedmont, Italy in 2004. Carlo Petrini and Massimo Montanari are the leading figures in the creation of the University, whose goal is to promote awareness of good food and nutrition.
