===Usage note===
*''Pop Tarts'' is a registered trademark of the [[Wikipedia:Kellogg Company|Kellogg Company]].  Due to market dominance of this brand, ''Pop Tart'' and its plural are frequently written entirely in lowercase and are often used generically to refer to any brand of toaster pastries.  Care should be taken to not do this, however, wherever trademark infringement concerns could occur.
