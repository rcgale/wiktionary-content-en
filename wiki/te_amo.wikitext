'''Te amo'''
It's the spanish way to say "i love you". Although it doesn't means exactly the same since "amar" (to love) its only used for the "poetic love", you don't use te amo to say "i love to sing" or "i love to jump". It is more like a "special word".

It means: 

'''te''' = "me to you"
'''amo''' = "i love"

Te amo = "love from me to you"

"Te amo" sounds like this: "TAY AHM-oh"
