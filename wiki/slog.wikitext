'''Slog''' ''v. to social network and blog''
The activity of social networking and blogging together in a combined environment. This is the natural progression within the recent growth of [[social networks]] and [[blogs]]. With the rapid development of blogs (e.g. [[Blogger]], [[Xanga]], [http://www.typepad.com TypePad]) and social networks (e.g. [[Friendster]], [[Orkut]], [[Linkedin]]), the next step is the combination of both into one environment. Some early-stages of slogs are [http://www.alwayson.network.com AlwaysOn], a high-tech community, and [http://www.1up.com 1UP.com], a video gamers' community.

Derivative of this new word would be 'slogging' and 'slogophere'.
