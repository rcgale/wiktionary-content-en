'''Political price fixing''' is a group of political parties band together to take opposing sides on certain issues, but take the same side on other issues. If the parties are powerful enough, voters on the opposite side of the other issues are left without a viable voting option. Instead, they must either not vote, vote for a canidate for another political party that stands no chance of winnning, or vote for one of the major political parties that most closely aligns with his/her beliefs. '''Political price fixing''' is essentially an [[oligopoly]] of political parties.
