Akan is the group name given to cover a number of dialects of the peoples of eastern Ivory Coast, south-central Ghana, and central Togo. Akan is has more than 7 million native speakers[2]. Migration has caused a significant diversity in the spoken varieties of Akan. Some of the principal dialects include (Asante and Akuapem) Twi, Fante, Bono, Wasa, Nzema, Baule and Anyi[3]. The dialects are further divided into clusters based on the levels of mutual intelligibility. Each cluster has mutual intelligibility greater than 80%[4]
