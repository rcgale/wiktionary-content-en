(derivational suffix):

1. used to convert an adjective into a noun; the property corresponding to that adjective, for example, prolix -> prolixity (the property of being prolix), triangular -> triangularity (the property of being triangular). However, for some adjectives a different suffix, -ness, must be used: e.g. redness, not redity.
