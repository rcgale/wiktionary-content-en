===Noun Phrase===
'''isoceles triangle'''

# (''geometry'') A [[triangle]] having two sides equal.

===Usage Note===
In strict mathematical usage, an isoceles triangle has ''at least'' two sides equal, since any triangle with three sides equal also has (any) two sides equal.  In this view, all [[equilateral]] triangles are also isoceles.  In casual usage, an isoceles triangle is understood to have the third side unequal to the other two.
