'''folk etymology''' (''plural'' '''folk etymologies''')

#A change in the form of a word based on popular misconception concerning the word's origin. In many cases the spelling of a word is "corrected" to correspond more closely with its apparent origin, particularly if the original word descended from terms no longer used.<br><br> For example the word we now spell "island" is actually derived entirely from Old English: "ig", meaning "water", and "land". It was later incorrectly believed that "island" derived from "isle" (which comes from the Latin "insula"), and the silent "s" was inserted to "correct" the spelling.<br><br>
#A [[false etymology]] (an incorrect explanation of the origin of a word) based on a popular misconception.<br><br>An example is the incorrect belief that "posh" (meaning "upper-class") is an acronym, from "port outward, starboard home"&mdash;the location of the coolest cabins in ships travelling between Britain and India.
