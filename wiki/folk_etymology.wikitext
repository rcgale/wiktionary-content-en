'''folk etymology''' (''plural'' '''folk etymologies''')

#An attempted but incorrect [[etymology]] of a word, based on the word's similarity to others rather than [[research]] into the origin of the word; examples of words having folk etymologies are [[gay]], [[golf]], [[posh]] and [[spam]], all of which claim, with no evidence, that these words are [[acronym]]s.
