'''folk etymology''' (''plural'' '''folk etymologies''')

#Believed [[etymology]] of a word based on commonsense but not confirmed by [[research]] into the origin of the word. In many cases the spelling of a word is "corrected" to correspond more closely with its apparent origin, particularly if the original word descended from terms no longer used. 

For example the word we now spell "island" is actually derived entirely from Old English: "ig", meaning "water", and "land". It was later incorrectly believed that "island" derived from "isle" (which comes from the Latin "insula"), and the silent "s" was inserted to "correct" the spelling.

An example of folk etymology which did not change spelling is the incorrect belief that "posh" (meaning "upper-class") is an acronym, from "port outward, starboard home"&mdash;the location of the coolest cabins in ships travelling between Britain and India.
