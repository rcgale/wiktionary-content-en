"'''9 to 5'''" is the title of a hit song for the [[1980 in film|1980]] film comedy ''[[Nine to Five]]'' starring [[Jane Fonda]], [[Lily Tomlin]] and [[Dolly Parton]] in her film [[debut]]. The title song was written and performed by Parton, gaining an [[Academy Award]] nomination and a [[Grammy Award]]. It reached #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and was also #78 on [[American Film Institute]]'s 100 years, 100 songs.

"'''9 to 5'''" is also the title of a popular song recorded by [[Sheena Easton]] in [[1980]], becoming her first major hit. The title of the song was changed to "Morning Train (9 to 5)" for North American release to avoid confusion with the Dolly Parton song mentioned, above.

It's interesting to note the extreme differences between the two "9 to 5" songs, even though they were recorded the same year. Parton's song is about female liberation (as is the movie), while Easton's song is about a woman who waits at home all day for her man to come home from work.
