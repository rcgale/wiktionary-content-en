===Etymology===
From ''gramarye'' < Middle English ''gramery'' < Old French ''gramaire'' ("classical learning") < Latin ''[[grammatica]] < Greek ''[[γραμματική]] [[τέχνη]]'' ("art of letters") < ''[[γράμμα]]'' ("letter") < [[γράφειν]] ("to write") < Proto-Indo-European base '''*gerebh-''' ("to scratch").
Note that "grammar" and "glamour" both derive from the same root, relics of a time when being able to read and write was an arcane skill with a whiff of sorcery. A scribe was seen as enchanted (glamourous) and with a knowledge of grammar.
