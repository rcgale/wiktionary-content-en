#:*'''1786''': [[Halbert]]s differ very little from the [[bill]], being like them constructed both for [[push]]ing and [[cutt]]ing: a halbert consists of three parts, the [[spear]], or sometimes a kind of [[sword]] blade for pushing, an [[ax]], or [[hatchet]] for striking and cutting, and a [[flook]] or [[hook]] for pulling down [[fascine]]s, in the [[attack]] of [[trench]]es, or temporary [[fortification]]s. &mdash; Francis Grose, ''A Treatise on Ancient Armour and Weapons'', page 51.
