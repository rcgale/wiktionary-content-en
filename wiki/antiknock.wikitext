An '''antiknock''' compound is a chemical [[additive]], usually tetraethyl [[lead]] which is blended into [[gasoline]] to prevent the occurrence of [[knock]], or a mechanical [[ping]]ing sound which is caused by improper combustion of gasoline or insufficient octane.  The addition of lead to gasoline was typically used as an inexpensive way to boost the performance of fuel over increasing the octane value.

The development of the [[catalytic converter]] as an emissions control device, which requires the use of [[unleaded]] gasoline, essentially eliminated the use of lead in gasoline.
