# occupying a position midway between two ends or sides
# occupying a position that is an equal distance between several [[point]]s.  Note that in a one-dimensional space this position can be identifed with two points, in a two-dimensional space with three points (not on the same straight line), and in a three-dimensional space with four points (not in the same [[plane]]).
