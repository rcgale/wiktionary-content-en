Egocaster

The combination of the individuals� need to capture and share with others, what is happening in his or her life, with the availability of hardware, software and skills to produce acceptable/good quality digital material and the availability of an potentially enormous on-line audience has combined into a revolution in publishing and broadcasting, i.e. the �����Egocaster�����.
��Ego�� in English has something of an arrogant overtone, much more  than in other languages. But an �����Egocaster�����, in this case, means the person is passionate rather than egotistical. They are purveyors of passion, sharing rather than shouting. Their ��Ego�� is the best way to describe what drives them and the direction the material is published from, namely from the individual.

�����Egocaster = Ego + Technology + Network����� 

Examples of the rapid growth of �����egocaster����� pulbishing are plentiful, including we[[blog]]s and [[podcast]]s.
