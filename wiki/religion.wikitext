==== Usage note ====
Generally speaking, systems of belief that do not involve the existence of one or more [[dieties]], such as [[Buddhism]], can be considered a religion, though some people prefer a stricter definition that excludes the possibility of a non-theistic religion.  Others are in favor of a very general definition of religion: that any belief or system of beliefs is a religion or part of a religion, including [[science]] and [[atheism]].
