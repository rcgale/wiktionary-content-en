===Noun===

#a beverage or a drink made with caramel, and carbonated water.
#The kola nut (cola nut) is the edible seed of several species of tropical trees of the Cola genus native to Africa (especially Cola acuminata and Cola nitada). They are cultivated today in both Africa and the American tropics, where they are chewed to retard fatigue and hunger.  Kola nuts have a bitter initial taste, then sweet, and also sweeten any food or drink taken immediately afterward. Kola nuts contain caffeine and theobromine, and are famous for their use in 'Cola' soft drinks. Many soft drink manufacturers now use synthetic chemicals that resemble the flavor of kola nuts.
