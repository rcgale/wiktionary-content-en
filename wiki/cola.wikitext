#The kola [[nut]] (cola nut) is the edible [[seed]] of several species of tropical trees of the ''Cola'' genus native to [[Africa]] (especially ''Cola acuminata'' and ''Cola nitada''). They are cultivated today in both Africa and the [[America|American]] tropics, where they are chewed to retard fatigue and hunger.  Kola nuts have a bitter initial taste, then sweet, and also sweeten any food or drink taken immediately afterward. Kola nuts contain [[caffeine]] and [[theobromine]], and are famous for their use in 'Cola' [[soft drink]]s. Many soft drink manufacturers now use synthetic chemicals that resemble the flavor of kola nuts.
