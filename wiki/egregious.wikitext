===Adjective===
#Exceptional, conspicuous. 
#:Webster also gives “distinguished” as an archaic form, and notes that its present form has an unpleasant connotation. It generally precedes such epithets as “rogue,” “rascal,” "ass," “blunderer” – but may be used complimentarily, or even on its own: “Sir, you are egregious.” The latter sense is only recommended when one is quite certain its object is unaware of its meaning.
