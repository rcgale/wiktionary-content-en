===Etymology===
From Latin prefix '''[[e-]]''', ''out of'', + '''[[grex]]''', '''[[gregis]]''', ''flock'', + English adjective suffix '''[[-ous]]''', from Latin suffix '''[[-osus]]''', ''full of''

===Adjective===
'''egregious'''

#Exceptional, conspicuous, outstanding

====Usage Note====
Webster also gives “distinguished” as an archaic form, and notes that its present form often has an unpleasant connotation (e.g., ''"an egregious error"''). It generally precedes such epithets as “rogue,” “rascal,” "ass," “blunderer” – but may also be used for a compliment, or even on its own: “Sir, you are egregious.” The latter sense is only recommended when one is quite certain its object is unaware of its meaning.
