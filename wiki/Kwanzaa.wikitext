===Noun===
Kwanzaa, pronounced ''Quon-zuh''
#Kwanzaa is a week-long [[African-American]] [[holiday]] held between December 26 and January 1.  Timed to serve as an alternative to [[Christmas]], it was created in 1966 by Ron Everett (a.k.a. Dr. Maulana Karenga), a convicted felon.  Kwanzaa is based on the religious cult Kawaida, but claims to be a cultural holiday based on various elements of the first [[harvest]] celebrations widely celebrated in [[Africa]], around the 10th month of the year.  Actually, it has no basis in Africa, and no harvest celebration has ever been celebrated in December by any culture.  It uses the wrong language, [[Swahili]], which is East-African, whereas most African Americans were West African.  [[Corn]], one of its seven symbols, is not indigenous to Africa.  It is comprised of seven symbols, and seven virtues.  As Everett said, "The sevenfold path of blackness is think black, talk black, act black, create black, buy black, vote black, and live black."
