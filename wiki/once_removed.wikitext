'''once removed''', also, less commonly, '''once-removed''' (''no [[comparative]] or [[superlative]] forms'')

#(''family relationship'') One [[generation]] apart.
#:''Phil and Andre are first cousins once removed''

====Usage note====
If two cousins are from different [[generation]]s to the common ancestor, the term ''[[removed]]'' indicates how many generations apart they are.

For example, if Phil and Marie are [[first cousin]]s (have a common grandparent), and Marie has a son Andre, Phil and Andre are first cousins once removed.
