The term '''Buffoon''' is a somewhat derogatory yet amusing term for a [[humour]]ous character who provides his amusement principally through [[stupidity]] rather than [[talent]]. The term [[clown]] is sometimes incorrectly used, although this more usually refers to professional entertainers who provide that sort of act for a living. A Buffoon is, " A ridiculous but nevertheless amusing person".

The term is often used to updraid naughty school children, e.g. "Stop that John - you Buffoon"

A person can become a Buffoon either through natural disorganisation and/or clumsiness, or by attempting to gain [[attention]] through [[humour]] but failing to pull it off. An individual may also choose to become a Buffoon in order to gain a unique place in a [[social group]], although this is generally a last resort.

University Degrees in Buffoonery were popular throughout the 19th Century but these fell in to disfavour in the early 20th Century; they are, however, making a comeback at certain institutions.

The term is not to be confused with [[Baboon]] (a large primate) or even [[Balloon]] (a coloured rubber sack which is then inflated with air or another sort of gas and then sealed at the neck)
