'''Buffoon''' is a somewhat derogatory term for a [[humour]]ous character who provides amusement principally by [[stupidity]] rather than [[talent]]. The term [[clown]] is also used, although this word more usually refers to professional entertainers who provide this sort of act for a living.

A person usually becomes a buffoon either through natural disorganisation and clumsiness, or by attempting to gain [[attention]] through [[humour]] but failing to pull it off. An individual may also choose to become a buffoon in order to gain a unique place in a [[social group]], although this is generally a last resort.

The word is derived from an [[18th-century]] [[French]] taxonomist named [[Georges Buffon]]. As the science of [[taxonomy]] progressed almost all of his conclusions were found to be completely useless and incorrect, hence the connotation of the term.

Degrees in Buffoonism were popular throughout the 18 Hundreds but fell in to disfavour in the early 20th Century. They are, however, making a comeback at certain institutions.

Not to be confused with [[Baboon]], a large primate.
