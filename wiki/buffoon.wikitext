'''Buffoon''' is a somewhat derogatory term for a [[humour]]ous character who provides amusement principally by [[stupidity]] rather than [[talent]]. The term [[clown]] is also used, although this word more usually refers to professional entertainers who provide this sort of act for a living.

A person usually becomes a buffoon either through natural disorganisation and clumsiness, or by attempting to gain [[attention]] through [[humour]] but failing to pull it off. An individual may also choose to become a buffoon in order to gain a unique place in a [[social group]], although this is generally a last resort.

Degrees in Buffoonism were popular throughout the 18 Hundreds but fell in to disfavour in the early 20th Century. They are, however, making a comeback at certain institutions.

Not to be confused with [[Baboon]], a large primate.
