Noun
1. Any small, secondary, emergency-use vehicle used to evacuate from the main vehicle during times of danger. Usually refers to a small pod-like capsule that fits a low number of people. Escape pods are common in science-fiction literature, and often are attached to spaceships, although marine varieties have been spotted.
