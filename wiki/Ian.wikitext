'''Ian''' is an anglicisation of ''E&oacute;in'', the [[gaelic]] form of the name [[John]].  The name originated in [[Ireland]], and was taken from there to [[Scotland]], where the modern form ''Iain'' co-exists with it.  In Ireland it was largely supplanted by the later forms ''Seaan'', ''Se&oacute;n'', and ''Se&oacute;an'', of which the modern form is ''Se&aacute;n'' (anglicised as ''[[Sean]]'').
