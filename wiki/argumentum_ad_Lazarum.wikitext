'''Argumentum ad lazarum''' is the [[logical fallacy]] of thinking a conclusion is correct because the subject of the argument is poor. 

:Example:
:''It was morally wrong to execute the Red captives, because they were driven into atrocities by desperation of poverty.''
:''Hermits are wise, they are not distracted by possessions''.
:''If you are so rich, why aren't you smart?''

The opposite is the [[argumentum ad crumenam]].
