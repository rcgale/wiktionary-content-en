===Noun===
'''automagic'''
# Automatic help.  Often offered unhelpfully because offered impersonally out of context.
# Refers to a process done [[automatic]]ally in such a clever way that the result looks like [[magic]].  The term is a [[portmanteau]] and can also be used in its adverbial form as ''automagically''.  It is drawn from the [[adage]] (often called [[w:Clarke's three laws|Clarke's third law]]) that any sufficiently-advanced [[technology]] is indistinguishable from magic.
