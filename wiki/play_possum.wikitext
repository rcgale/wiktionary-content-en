'''Playing possum''' is a phrase that means mean to pretend to be dead.

It comes from a characteristic of the [[Virginia opossum]], which is famous for pretending to be dead when threatened. This natural instinct does not alway pay off in the modern world: for example, opossums scavenging [[roadkill]] may use it in response to the threat of approaching traffic, and end up as roadkill themselves.
