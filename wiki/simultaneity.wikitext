===Noun===
# The quality or state of being [[simultaneous]]; [[simultaneousness]].
# In music a '''simultaneity''' is more than one complete musical texture occuring at the same time. This first appeared in the music of Charles Ives, and is common in the music of Conlon Nancarrow, and others.
# A '''[[pitch simultaneity]]''' is also more than one pitch or pitch class all of which occur at the same time. Simultaneity may be thought of as a more general term for any possible chord. Any chord progression or harmonic progression is then a simultaneity succession, though not all simultaneity successions are harmonic progressions and not all simultaneities are chords.
