'''Babushka''' (&#1073;ï¿½&#1073;&#1091;&#1096;&#1082;&#1072; {{Audio|ru-babushka.ogg|listen}}) is a [[Russian language|Russian]] word meaning "grandmother" or "old lady."

Some American English dictionaries define the word as a "kerchief for the head".  But some common usage in the West appears to diverge from the word's currently ([[2004]]) recorded definition. "Babushka" is never used in Russia to mean "kerchief for the head."
