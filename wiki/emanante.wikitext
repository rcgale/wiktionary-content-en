===Verb===

# Archaic but technically correct form of the verb [[emanate]]. 

===Etymology===

Emanante is derived from the {{LL.}} ''ex mano'', meaning ''from the hand''. It was used in [[Britain]] (pronounced AY-ma-NAHN-tee) until the invasion of the [[w:Normans|Normans]] in [[w:1066|1066]], whose [[French]] influence caused a redefinition in pronunciation (AY-ma-NOHNTS, rhyming with [[croissant]]). This pronunciation was too similar to the official title of [[w:William the Conqueror|William the Conqueror]], "His Eminence", for William's liking and so an N was dropped to create the modern verb form [[emanate]].
