# Archaic but technically correct form of the verb [[emanate]].

Emanante is derived from the Late Latin ''ex mano'', meaning ''from the hand''. It was used in [[Britain]] (pronounced AY-ma-NAHN-tee) until the invasion of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normans Normans] in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1066 1066], whose [[French]] influence caused a redefinition in pronunciation (AY-ma-NOHNTS, rhyming with [[croissant]]). This pronunciation was too similar to the official title of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror William the Conqueror], 'His Eminence', for William's liking and so an N was dropped to create the modern verb form [[emanate]].
