===Noun===
'''kudos''', singular noun
#Praise; accolades.
#:''The talented, young playwright received kudos for his new drama.''
===Usage===
*Although it ends in an -s and may fool people into thinking this is a plural noun, '''kudos''' actually comes from a Greek singular noun, and in English it is used as a singular noun as well.  A singular form "kudo" with plural "kudos" has been used, with the singular word meaning "a statement of praise," but this usage has been discouraged.  
*:'''Kudos''' ''is given if you avoid making the mistake of using a plural verb with this word.''
