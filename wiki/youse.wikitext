===Usage notes===
*The form ''youse'' is found mainly (but not exclusively) in various parts of the northern [[United States]] and [[Scotland]], particularly [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Chicago]], [[New York]] and [[Philadelphia]] in the US and [[Glasgow]] in the UK, while in the southern United states and AAVE, [[y'all]] is the more common form.
*In New York ''youse'' may be grammatically singular (''I don't know what youse is talking about'').
*The standard contraction for ''you is'' is ''you's'' (e.g., ''Talking to you's always fun.'').  In transcribing the AAVE usage of ''you is'' where standard English has ''you are'', either ''you's'' or ''youse'' is used.  E.g, either ''You's a damn fool'' or ''Youse a damn fool'' but never ''Talking to youse always fun''.
