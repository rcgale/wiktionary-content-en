In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the use of "youse" or "youse guys" was, and still is, quite common among the less educated.
Statements like, "Youse guys ain't got a chance.", and questions like, "Where youse been?" are every day fare.  
Perhaps this is a result of the influence of the Slavic languages so prevailent in the mid-West, whose native speakers, now in America, found it impossible to believe that such an advanced country would bear a language which did not differentiate between "you" singular and "you" plural!
