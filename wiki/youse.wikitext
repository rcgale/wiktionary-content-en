#: ''Where youse been?''
# (''[[w:African_American_Vernacular_English|AAVE]]'') Alternate spelling of [[you's]].

===Usage Notes===
The form ''youse'' is seen mainly (but not exclusively) in various parts of the Northern United States, particularly Minnesota, Wisconsin, Chicago, New York and Philadelphia, while [[y'all]] is seen mainly (but not exclusively) in the [[w:U.S._South|South]] of the United States and in [[w:African_American_Vernacular_English|AAVE]].

In New York ''youse'' may be treated as gramatically singular (''I don't know what youse is talking about'').

While the spelling ''you's'' may be used generally (''Talking to you's always fun.'') or in AAVE (''You's a damn fool.''), the spelling ''youse'' is only used for the second case (''Youse a damn fool'' but not ''Talking to youse always fun.'').
