'''''Wasei-eigo''''' (&#21644;&#35069;&#33521;&#35486; ''wasei eigo'', lit. "Made-in-Japan English") refers to [[English language|English]] constructions not in use in [[Anglophone]] countries nor by Anglophones, but only by speakers of [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

One example is the word ''desk''. It seems like perfectly good English, but in Japan, it it is a title for a person. ''Tanaka-desk'' would be a reporter or editor in charge of a department at a newspaper (e.g. the city desk).
