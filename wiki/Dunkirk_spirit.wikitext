'''The Dunkirk spirit''' is a phrase used to describe the tendency of the British public to pull together to overcome times of adversity.  It came into use following the evacuation of allied troops across the [[English Channel]] by a flotilla of civilian pleasure boats at the [[Battle of Dunkirk]].  The evacuation was codenamed [[Operation Dynamo]].
