'''The Dunkirk spirit''' is a phrase used to describe the tendency of the British public to pull together to overcome times of adversity.  It came into use following the evacuation of allied troops across the [[English Channel]] by a flotilla of civilian pleasure boats at the [[Battle of Dunkirk]] in 1940.  In nine days, 338,226 French and British soldiers were taken off the beach by a ragtag fleet of over nine hundred vessels.  The evacuation was codenamed [[Operation Dynamo]].

The [[St George's Cross]] flown from the [[Maritime_flags#Jacks|jack staff]] is known as the '''Dunkirk jack''', and is only flown by civilian ships and boats of all sizes which took part in the Dunkirk rescue operation.
