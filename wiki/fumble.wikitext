===Verb===

'''fumble''' (fumbles, fumbling, fumbled)

#To try to get something by touching and identifying it from its shape and texture, because the object cannot be identified by vision (not visible due to darkness, etc.).
#: ''He fumbled for a torch when there was a sudden blackout.''
Example: There is a box, designed so that your hands can get in, but you can't see the objects in it. The box is filled with cubes, balls, and cylinders. You are instructed to get a ball. You put in your hands. You feel the object. You think it's not a ball, because it has a pointed edge. You release the object and feel the other object. It is very smooth and grasping it convenient. You think that is a ball. You take it. Either the object is really a ball or not, we said '''you have fumbled for the ball.'''
