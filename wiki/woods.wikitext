==English==

===Noun===
'''woods'''
#Plural sense of [[wood]].
#(''[[uncountable]]'') A dense collection of trees covering a relatively small area; smaller than a [[forest]].

====Usage note====
One does not say ''"I was lost in the '''wood''',"'' but rather ''"I was lost in the '''woods'''."''  Unless of course, the [[forest]] you are in consists of only one single [[tree]], in which case it is clearer to speak of that lone tree directly.
<!-- Is this true also in UK, or is it a USism? -->

====Translations====

'''collection of trees'''
