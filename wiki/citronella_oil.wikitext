Oil of citronella is one of the important essential oils obtained from different species of Cymbopogon.  The oil is used extensively as a source of important perfumery chemicals like citronellal, citronellol and geraniol, which find extensive use in soap, perfumery, cosmetic and flavouring industries throughout the world.

Citronella oil is classified in trade into two types – Ceylon citronella oil, obtained from Cymbopogon nardus Rendle, is the inferior type, while Java Type citronella oil obtained from Cymbopogon winterianus Jowitt, is considered superior.  Both of these have probably originated from Mana Grass of Ceylon, which according to Finnemore (1962) occurs today in two wild forms – Cymbopogon nardus var. linnae (typicus and C. Nardus var. confertiflorus.  Both of these forms are not known  to be used for distillation to any appreciable extent.  The Java citronella and the name Cymbopogon winterianus is given to this selected variety to commemorate one Mr. Winter – an important oil distiller of Ceylon, who first cultivated and distlled Maha Pangeri type of citronella in Ceylon.

At present, the world production of citronella oil is approximately 7,000 tonnes, the bulk of which is produced in Taiwan, Guatemala, Honduras, Indonesia, Brazil, China, Ceylon, India, Argentina, Equador, Madagascar, Mexico and West Indies.
