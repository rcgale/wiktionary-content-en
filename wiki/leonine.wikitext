*'''1887''': He [Landor] was a man of somewhat '''leonine''' aspect as regards the general appearance and expression of the head and face, which accorded well with the large and massive build of the figure, and to which a superbly curling white beard added not only picturesqueness, but a certain nobility. &mdash; Anthony Trollope, ''What I Remember, Volume 2, '' Chapter XIV.
