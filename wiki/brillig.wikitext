The word '''''brillig''''' was coined by [[Lewis Carroll]] in his [[poem]] "[[Jabberwocky]]" from ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. According to ''[[Misch-Masch]]'', a handwritten [[magazine]] produced by Carroll in [[1855]] for his family and friends, "bryllyg is 'the time of broiling dinner, i.e. the close of the afternoon". It is derived from the verb to BRYL or BROIL. Note that in ''Misch-Masch'' ''bryllyg'' is spelt with two ''y''s rather than with two ''i''s as were used later in the published version of ''Looking-Glass''.

[[Humpty Dumpty]] (in chapter 6 of ''Through the Looking-Glass'') agrees with the definition given by Carroll in 'Misch-Masch' when he states, " 'Brillig' means four o'clock in the afternoon&mdash;the time when you begin broiling things for dinner."
