'''Nomen Nescio''', abbreviated to '''N.N.''', is used to signify an [[anonymous]] or non-specific person. The literal translation is "I don't know (his) name".

The generic name [[Numerius Negidius]] used in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times was chosen partly because it shared initials with this phrase.
