Astromathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with astronomically-related activity.  It is different from theorectical astronomy in that alone, it does not make any physical predictions.  It is moreso used as a tool to study astronomical predictions.  i.e., Albert Einstein used differential geometry and tensor analysis as tools to formulate the Theory of Relativity.
