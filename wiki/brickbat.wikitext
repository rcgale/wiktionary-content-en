A brickbat was originally a term used to describe a piece of brick used as a weapon, especially if thrown, or placed in something like a sock and used as a club.

More recently, a brickbat describes a criticism or uncomplimentary remark hurled at the recipient. For example, it's quite common for magazines to have a section called "Bouquets and Brickbats" for compliments and criticisms.
