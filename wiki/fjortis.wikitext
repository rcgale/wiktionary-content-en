'''Fjortis''' (pronounced "fyore-tiss" with the y being a consonant) - plural "fjortisar" - comes from "fjorton", which is Swedish for "fourteen". The most basic meaning of the word is "a person of either sex who behaves like he/she is fourteen years old"; however, fjortisar can be of any age between 12 and 18. Generally a "fjortis" is an annoying, immature, irresponsible, stupid teenage girl, but there are male ones too. On the Internet they're always InTurNeT GuRLz, and their primary hangout on the Internet is www.lunarstorm.se which is Sweden's biggest (and most hated) community. A typical fjortis activity is to drink light beer/homemade liquor in public parks, where they swarm like seagulls 
in the warmer seasons of the year; "fjortisfylla", or "fjortis drunkedness", is a widely recognized concept in Sweden. They invariably vomit all over their shoes and get taken to either the hospital or home to their parents by bored policemen.

Some people of fjortis age (12-18), predominantly male, often claim to viciously hate fjortisar, probably because they're young and insecure and just as fjortis themselves.
