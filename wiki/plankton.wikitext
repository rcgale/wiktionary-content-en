'''Plankton''' is the name given to all the [[microorganism]]s that float on the [[sea]]. The name comes from the [[Greek language]] term for "wanderer" or "drifter".
Plankton are divided in two classes: phytoplankton and zooplankton:

*'''Phytoplankton''' (phyto: vegetal) are small [[algae]] and [[fungi]]. They obtain energy by [[photosynthesis]], and live mostly on the upper part of the sea, because they need [[light]] to survive.
*'''Zooplankton''' (zoo: animal) are small [[protozoa]], [[crustacean]]s, [[krill]], etc. and the [[egg]]s and [[larvae]] from larger animals. [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton]
