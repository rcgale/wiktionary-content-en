NASA Structural Analysis System, general purpose Finite Element Analysis (FEA) program.

In the early 1960s, the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) determined that a large scale finite element-based program was an enabling technology for designing the space system for lunar exploration.
The analysis system was called the NASA Structural Analysis System, NASTRAN.

The development team included The MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation (MSC, in 1999, the MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation changed its name to MSC.Software Corporation). The NASTRAN system was released to NASA in 1968. In the late 1960s, MSC started to market and support its own version of NASTRAN, called MSC.Nastran.
