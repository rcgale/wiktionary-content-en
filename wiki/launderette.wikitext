===Noun===
'''launderette''' (''plural'' '''launderettes''')

====Variant spellings====
*'''laundrette'''

#A place that has facilities for washing and drying clothes that the public may pay to use.
<!--Moved from Laundromat, although this does not add much to the definition:
[[coin-operated]] [[washing machine]]s, [[dryer]]s, and sometimes [[ironing]] or pressing machines for washing [[clothing]] and household [[cloth]] items; 

In the ''US'', a distinction is made between a laundromat, which is a business enterprise, and [[laundry]] facilities provided at [[apartment]] houses and [[mobile home]] parks. The latter are smaller and usually not open to the public.
