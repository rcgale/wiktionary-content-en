===Abbreviation/symbol===
'''ft'''

#[[Foot]] (''unit of length'').

==={{Abbreviation}}===
'''Ft'''

#(''also'' '''ft.''') [[Fort]].

====Usage Note====
As this abbreviation only eliminates the use of one character, the full word, [[Fort]], is generally preferred.  It is also never appropriate to use this abbreviation in body text in any form.  The same applies to [[Mt]] for [[Mount]], [[So]] for [[South]], and [[No]] for [[North]].  Use of Ft is only appropriate when space necessitates.
