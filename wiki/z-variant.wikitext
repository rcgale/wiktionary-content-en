===Etymology===
[[z]] (axis) + [[variant]]; from the three dimensions visualized for the character space.   The x-axis separates characters by semantics (function and meaning, e.g. ''A'' from ''B''), the y-axis separates them by their general form (abstract shape, e.g. ''A'' from ''a''), and the z-axis by their actual shape (minor details such as typeface, e.g. ''a'' from '''''a''''').

===Noun===
'''z-variant''' (''plural:'' [[z-variants]])
# ''([[Unicode]])'' a shape variant of a Han character, encoded for historical reasons.
