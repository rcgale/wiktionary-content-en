=====Usage note=====
A body or organization that dictates '''standards''' does not exist to confer details about a single standard.  ''Standard'' as an adjective generally refers to a specific version of a ''standard'' issued by a '''standards''' institution; that ''standard'' version itself will actually be a list of many individual ''standards''.)  For example, ANSI ''Standard'' MUMPS refers to the 1995 MUMPS programming language specification issued by the American National '''Standards''' Institute, a '''standards''' organization.  1995 MUMPS ''standard'' specifies many ''standards'' that a programming language must adhere to, to be legitimately recognised as "''standard'' MUMPS."
