The "future perfect" tense is that tense formation of a verb in many languages (but not all, such as Chinese or Japanese or Farsi, as examples) that exhibits an action completed (perfected) in the future before some other time.  Thus, in the sentence, "I shall have eaten when the curtain goes up," "shall have eaten" tells the reader that the eating will be completed (perfected) by the time the "curtain goes up."  A couple of other examples: "I shall have been eaten by worms when the next century rolls around."  "I shall have beded her thoroughly by the time she realizes what a cad I am."
