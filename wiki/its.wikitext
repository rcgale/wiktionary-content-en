===Etymology===
Originally, the genitive case form of the word [[it]]; compare with "his", "hers", "ours", "yours", ''et cetera''.

The belief that ''its'' derived from ''it's'' or was a contraction of some longer form, or that it bears any relationship to the possessive apostrophe-s, are common misapprehensions.
