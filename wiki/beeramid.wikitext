A '''Beeramid''' is a [[pyramid]] made from discarded [[beer]] cans. 

Often found in places frequented by [[drinking|drinkers]], a large beeramid was often a monument to the local party [[scene]]. Inspired by films such as [[National Lampoon's Animal House]] during the heyday of [[party|party culture]], beeramids were most frequently seen during the late [[1970s]], the [[1980s]], and the early [[1990s|'90s]], and could often be found in [[frat]] houses, [[dorm]]s, and other collegiate locations throughout the US, as well as at so-called [[white trash]] dwellings and other places where canned beer was consumed in volume. Beeramids were rarely erected in commercial establishments, however, due to the potential impedance to service and possible liability of the owners. 

Beeramids were often built as empty beer cans became available, slowly growing as the night (or week or month) wore on. In most cases, though, a beeramid was a [[impermanence|temporary]] structure, eventually giving way to the inevitable clean-up or accidental distruction. The impermanence of the beeramid structure lends itself to easily removing the structure from wherever it has grown; combined with the great ease of creating a [[structure]] of relatively impressive size, beeramids remain popular today, especially when one considers it is often easier to contribute an empty beer [[can]] to the beeramid, than it is to deposit the can in the appropriate [[recycling|recycling receptacle]]. 

''''Beeramid'''' is also the name of a [[drinking game]].
