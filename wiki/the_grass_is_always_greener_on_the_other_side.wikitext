===Proverb===
'''The grass is always greener on the other side'''
# One is inclined to overestimate the attractiveness of situations one is not in.

Note: this proverb does not only use a metaphor (green grass = attractiveness) but it is a statement that is so evidently untrue ("other situations are always better") that the point of it is not what it says but the fact that people tend to think so.

===Translations===
*French: L'herbe est toujours plus verte de l'autre côté.
*Spanish: El cesped es siempre más verde al otro lado.
*Russian: Трава всегда зеленее по другую сторону забора [assumption: ...on the other side '''of the fence''']; This is not necessarily an idiomatic expression in Russian, though. An analogue of this idiom is the following: "Соседняя очередь всегда движется быстрее" [''[[The other queue always moves faster]]''; derived from [[w:Murphy's laws|Murphy's laws]]].
