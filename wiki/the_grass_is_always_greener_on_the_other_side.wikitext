[[Idiom]]
One is inclined to overestimate the attractiveness of situations one is not in.

Note: this proverb does not only use a metaphor (green grass = attractiveness) but it is a statement that is so evidently untrue ("other situations are always better") that the point of it is not what it says but the fact that people tend to think so.

Translations:
*French: l'herbe est toujours plus verte de l'autre côté.
*Spanish: el cesped es siempre más verde al otro lado.
