To have "the fantods" is to be in a state of nervousness/distrees/anxiety.

The first appearence of this world recorded was from 1839, in the book "[[Adventures of Harry Franco]]" by [[Charles Biggs]], in which it was used like so: : “You have got strong symptoms of the fantods; your skin is so tight you can’t shut your eyes without opening your mouth”.

It was also heavily used by [[Mark Twain]]'s [[Huckleberry Finn]] books. It has been used by famous authors such as [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[John Galsworthy]] and [[Bentle]].
