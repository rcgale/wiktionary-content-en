To have "the fantods" is to be in a state of nervousness, distress, or anxiety.

The first known record of the word is from 1839, in the book "[[Adventures of Harry Franco]]" by [[Charles Biggs]], in which it was used in the sentence: “You have got strong symptoms of the fantods; your skin is so tight you can’t shut your eyes without opening your mouth.”

It was also heavily used by [[Mark Twain]]'s [[Huckleberry Finn]] books. It has been used by famous authors such as [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[John Galsworthy]], and [[Bentle]].
