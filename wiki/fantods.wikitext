To have "the '''fantods'''" is to be in a state of nervousness, distress, or anxiety.

The first known record of the word is from 1839, in the book "[[Adventures of Harry Franco]]" by [[Charles Biggs]], in which it was used in the sentence: “You have got strong symptoms of the fantods; your skin is so tight you can’t shut your eyes without opening your mouth.”

[[Mark Twain]]'s [[Huckleberry Finn]] ([[1885]]) said:
:But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees. I went for it, cautious and slow. By and by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It most give me the fantods.

It has been used by famous authors such as [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[John Galsworthy]], and [[Bentle]].  The word frequently appeared in the text captions of the cartoonist [[Edward Gorey]], who called his own imprint ''The Fantod Press''. The word also appears numerous times in David Foster Wallace's "[[Infinite Jest]]".
