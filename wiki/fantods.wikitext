To have "the fantods" is to be in a state of nervousness, distress, or anxiety.

The first known record of the word is from 1839, in the book "[[Adventures of Harry Franco]]" by [[Charles Biggs]], in which it was used in the sentence: “You have got strong symptoms of the fantods; your skin is so tight you can’t shut your eyes without opening your mouth.”

It was also heavily used by [[Mark Twain]]'s [[Huckleberry Finn]] books. It has been used by famous authors such as [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[John Galsworthy]], and [[Bentle]].

[[The Fantods Dance]] was a dance named after the word "fantods," created to embody the very spirit of [[randomness]] and, to a lesser extent, [[biology]]. It was created in the [[21st Century]] by visionary [[Australian]] [[biologists]] [[Alistair Roche]] and [[Alisa Sedghifar]]. The dance involves moving in '[[8|figure eights]]' that, after each cycle, change [[angle]] and increase [[width]]. After the figure eights have surpassed a full 360 [[degree]] [[rotation]], jumping up and down procedes, along with flailing of arms. The [[enigma|enigmatic]] [[dance]] is finished with an exulted [[high five]]. The Fantods Dance has come under criticism in recent years for its difficulty to really learn, and it's popularity at [[punk rock]] [[concerts]], where, done [[en masse]], people can be injured.
