Australian alang (offensive) term for illegal immigrants or [[refugees]] attempting to enter the country by see [[boat people]].
Influenced by the term [[regatta]] meaning "boat race(s)" and the fact that there are certain times of the year when major influxes of immigrants are experienced (normally the cooler months).

Popularised in a song by Redgum called "Caught In The Act".

at sunset, have a few cans, and watch what they call up in
