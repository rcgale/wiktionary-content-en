'''Refugee Regatta''' is an (offensive) [[Australia]]n [[slang]] term for illegal immigrants or [[refugees]] attempting to enter the country by sea (a.k.a. [[boat people]]). 
Influenced by the term [[regatta]] meaning "boat race(s)" and the fact that there are certain times of the year when major influxes of immigrants are experienced (normally the cooler months).

Popularised in a song by [[Redgum]] called "Caught In The Act".

Excerpt of lyrics ([http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~lpcam/caughtact.html#caughtact Full lyrics available here])

:''Get an Esky, fill it full of cans, get your dope, go down to the beach, roll a big [[spliff]] about that long sit on the beach at sunset, have a few cans, and watch what they call up in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] the Refugee Regatta.''
