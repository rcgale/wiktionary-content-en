===Quotations===
'''1770''': The influence of Government, thus divided in appearance between the Court and the leaders of parties, became in many cases an accession rather to the popular than to the royal scale; and some part of that influence, which would otherwise have been possessed as in a sort of '''mortmain''' and unalienable domain, returned again to the great ocean from whence it arose, and circulated among the people.  &mdash; Edmund Burke, ''Thoughts on the Present Discontents, and Speeches'', 1770
