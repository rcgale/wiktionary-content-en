A '''God complex''' is a term used to characterize [[arrogant]] individuals prone to [[stupid]] actions, despite their being highly educated, worldly, or powerful.  A person with a [[God]] complex is said to suffer from the [[delusion]] he or she is, at the very least, the Almighty's gift to the world.  Terms such as [[group think]], [[expert worship]], and 'God complex' have been coined to explain various incarnations of this phenomenon. 

==Scholarly research==

There are few academic works specifically addressing God complexes, although a great deal can be found about [[narcissism]].

Psychiatry has offered alternative terminology, such as 'compensatory narcissistic personality disorder', which corresponds to [[Ernest Jones]]'s 'narcissistic God Complex', Heinz Kohut's 'narcissistic personality disorder', and Theodore Millon's 'Compensatory Narcissist'.

In the book ''All Mighty: A Study of the God Complex in Western Man'', by [[Horst Richter]] (ISBN 0897930282), [[authoritarian]] [[compulsion|compulsions]] are related to the [[rebel|rebellious]] stage of childhood development.  Richter examines how the arrested development of such compulsions leads to denial of suffering, self-doubt, and death, and an expectation of [[servile|servility]] for women and minorities.
