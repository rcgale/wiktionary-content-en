A '''God complex''' is a term used to characterize [[arrogant]], individuals prone to [[stupid]] actions, despite their being highly educated, worldly, or powerful.  A person with a [[God]] complex is said to suffer from the [[delusion]] he or she is, at the very least, the [[Almighty|Almighty's]] gift to the world.  Terms such as [[group think]], [[expert worship]], and 'God complex' have been coined to explain various incarnations of this phenomenon. 

==God complexes and man-made disasters==

In direct proportion to a given disparity of [[wealth]] and [[power]], the opportunities escalate for individuals to assume [[inhuman]], and sometimes [[inhumane]], [[dominionist|dominion]] over others.  God complexes are sometimes blamed for monumental man made disasters, including [[global warming]], the [[Bhopal]] chemical spill, and incessant flooding in China.  As wealth and power is consolidated into the hands of individuals at the helm of ever larger organizations and nations, it has become increasingly evident that powerful, and generally very intelligent, people sometimes do incredibly stupid things that contribute to man-made disasters, or compound the tragedy of natural disasters.

==Scholarly research==

There are few academic works specifically addressing God complexes, although a great deal can be found about [[narcissism]].

Psychiatry has offered alternative terminology, such as 'compensatory narcissistic personality disorder', which corresponds to [[Ernest Jones]]'s 'narcissistic God Complex', Heinz Kohut's 'narcissistic personality disorder', and Theodore Millon's 'Compensatory Narcissist'.

In the book ''All Mighty: A Study of the God Complex in Western Man'', by [[Horst Richter]] (ISBN 0897930282), [[authoritarian]] [[compulsion|compulsions]] are related to the [[rebel|rebellious]] stage of childhood development.  Richter examines how the arrested development of such compulsions leads to denial of suffering, self-doubt, and death, and an expectation of [[servile|servility]] for women and minorities.
