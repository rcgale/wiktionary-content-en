A '''god complex''' is a term used to characterize stupid actions by those who may be highly educated, worldly, or powerful. It is an important subject as it is increasingly evident that powerful, and generally very intelligent, people sometimes do stupid things. Notions such as [[group think]] or god complexes have been developed to explain this phenomenon. 

There are few academic works on the subject.
