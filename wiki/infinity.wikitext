==English==

===Etymology===
From Latin '''[[infinitas]]''', ''unlimitedness'', from negative prefix '''[[in-]]''', ''not'', + '''[[finis]]''', ''end'', + noun of state suffix '''[[-tas]]'''

===Noun===
'''infinity''',  ''plural:'' '''[[infinities]]''' ''(countable and uncountable)''

# Limitlessness, unlimitedness, something which is growing without limits or bounds.
# A number that has an [[infinite]], uncountable numerical value.
# A number which is very large compared to some characteristic number.  For example, in [[optics]], an object which is much further away than the [[focal length]] of a [[lens]] is said to be "at infinity", as the distance of the image from the lens varies very little as the distance increases further.

===Usage note===
In mathematics there are several different infinities; see [[transfinite]].
