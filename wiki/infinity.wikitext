From Latin '''[[infinitas]]''', ''unlimitedness'', from negative prefix '''[[in-]]''', ''not'', + '''[[finis]]''', ''end'', + noun of state suffix '''[[-tas]]'''

===Noun===
'''infinity''', plural '''[[infinities]]''' ''(countable and uncountable)''

# limitlessness, unlimitedness, something which is without limits or bounds
# a number that has an [[infinite]], uncountable numerical value
# a number which is very large compared to some characterisitic number. For example, in [[optics]], an object which is much further away than the [[focal length]] of a [[lens]] is said to be "at infinity", as the distance of the image from the lens varies very little as the distance increases further.
