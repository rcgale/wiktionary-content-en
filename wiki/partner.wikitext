'''''Partner''''' is often used as a more general, age- or [[gender-neutral]] term for [[boyfriend]], [[girlfriend]], [[spouse]], [[wife]], [[husband]], and one shorter than [[significant other]] and [[domestic partnership|domestic partner]].
However, using the term ''partner'' can also indicate more commitment than eg. ''boyfriend'' or ''girlfriend'' would imply. 

In the context of [[business]], a partner is a member of a [[partnership]], or relationship between individuals or groups that seeks mutual [[economic]] benefit through [[cooperation]].  For example, a partner in a law firm is a co-owner of that firm, and not just an [[employee]].
