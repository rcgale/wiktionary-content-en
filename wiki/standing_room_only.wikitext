[[sports|Sporting]] events are described as '''standing room only''' when they are extremely well-attended, where all of the [[chair]]s around an [[arena]] are filled up with people, only leaving flat spaces of pavement for other attendees to stand.  Some venues specifically give out standing-room-only (or '''SRO''') [[ticket]]s for a reduced cost, since it can become very uncomfortable to stand through the course of a game.  However, some [[fan (aficionado)|fans]] actually prefer standing-room-only tickets, as the crowds that gather can be more active than people who are sitting down for much of the event.  Such crowds can become dangerous, however, with [[riot]]s and crushing movements occasionally occurring and resulting in [[death]] or [[injury]].
