===Noun===
'''idiot''' ([[idiots]])

#  A common term for a person of low general intelligence.
#  A [[medical]] or [[psychological]] term meaning a person who has an intelligence quotient (IQ) below 20 (or 30?)
# In ancient Athens, an idiot was a person who declined to take part in public life, such as democratic city government. Since such activities were honorable and could directly affect all citizens, idiot was a term of derision.

The word comes from the Greek word ιδιωτης, idiôtês, "a private citizen, individual", from ιδιος, idios, "private".

An example of the word's use is as follows:-

"Dave, You know that homework you leant me?"

"Yes."

"Well, I kind of lost it."

"You '''Idiot'''!"
