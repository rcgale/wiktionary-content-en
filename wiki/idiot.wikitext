===Noun===
'''idiot''' ([[idiots]])

#  A common term for a person of low general intelligence.
#  A person of [[normal]] [[intelligence]] who is not [[giving]] enough [[thought]] to the job that they are currently doing.
#  A [[medical]] or [[psychological]] term meaning a person who has an intelligence quotient (IQ) below 20 (or 30?)
#  (humorous) Someone who is driving slower than you are, who is capable of [[driving]] much faster.  Thus a person driving a piece of [[construction]] [[equipment]] like a [[backhoe]] at 15 [[miles]] per [[hour]] down a [[city]] [[street]] is not an idiot, while a person driving a modern car at 45 miles per hour on a fast [[expressway]] would be termed an idiot.  Note:  Comedian George Carlin [[proffered]] this definition.
#  (humorous) Someone whose picture you would like to see in this dictionary beside this word.

===Examples===
That idiot is standing there staring into space, blocking all of us from getting where we want to go.
