3.  A [[medical]] or [[psychological]] term meaning a person who has an intelligence quotient (IQ) between 70 and 80.

4.  (humorous) Someone who is driving slower than you are, who is capable of [[driving]] much faster.  Thus a person driving a piece of [[construction]] [[equipment]] like a [[backhoe]] at 15 [[miles]] per [[hour]] down a [[city]] [[street]] is not an idiot, while a person driving a modern car at 45 miles per hour on a fast [[expressway]] would be termed an idiot.  Note:  Comedian George Carlin [[proffered]] this definition.

5.  (humorous) Someone whose picture you would like to see in this dictionary beside this word.
