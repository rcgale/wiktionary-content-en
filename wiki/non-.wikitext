==English==
===Etymology===
Latin ''[[non]]'', Old Latin ''[[noenu]]'', ''[[noenum]]'', from ''[[neoenum]]'', literally, not one. See [[none]]

===Prefix===
'''non-'''

#A prefix used in the sense of [[not]] to negate the meaning of the word to which it is attached, as in [[nonattention]] (or [[non-attention]]), [[nonconformity]], [[nonmetallic]] and [[nonsuit]].

====Usage notes====
*The prefix '''non-''' may be joined to a word by means of a hyphen, which is standard in British usage.  In many cases, especially in North American usage, '''non''' is joined without a hyphen, but a hyphen is preferred if its absence would obscure the understanding of the word.  Some '''non-''' words rarely or never use a hyphen (such as '''nonentity''').
*'''Non''' meaning ''not'' in phrases taken from Latin and some other languages, '''non''' is a separate word and is not hyphenated.  Examples: [[non compos mentis]], [[persona non grata]].
*As '''non-''' is a living prefix, the list of words having the prefix '''non-''' is practically unlimited.
*'''Non-''' may be attached to nouns, verbs, adjectives or adverbs to negate their meaning.
