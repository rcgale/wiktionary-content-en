A '''food court''' is a type of indoor plaza contiguous with the counters of multiple food vendors and providing a common area for self-serve dining. In the [[United States]], food courts became popular in the [[1980s]] in [[shopping mall]]s and [[airport]]s. Food courts are sometimes found in other [[tourism|tourist]] areas, such as [[Quincy Market]] in downtown [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], a historic market that has been entirely converted to a indoor food court. Food courts are distinct from eateries such as cookie stands, which are classified as autonomous units for mid-mall snacking. (Ref: [[Mallrats]])


==Setup==

Food courts usually (but not always) consist of several small counters of [[fast food]] outlets, sometimes with more upscale restaurants may be located nearby.  Some current [[U.S.]] fast food chains consist entirely or primarily of food court outlets (notably [[Chik-fil-a]] and [[Cinnabon]]) but food courts may also contain outlets of more conventional fast-food outlets such as [[Burger King]]. 

In [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], a local variation of the food court is extremely common, particularly in [[shopping mall]]s. Instead of fast food outlets, the counters sell local cuisine of the type normally obtainable in the formerly ubiquitous [[hawker centre]]s. Hawker centres, which are essentially open air versions of the food court, are increasingly being replaced by food courts in the two countries. This is due to the increasing affluence of their populations, as well as the association of hawker centres with unhygeinic food and a less comfortable environment.

At a typical food court, patrons order their meals at one of the many counters, then carry the meal to the common dining area on a standardized tray. The common dining area often has a vaulted ceiling or skylights in order to provide a roomier atmosphere with better illumination.

==Benefits==

Since the area for the consumption of purchased goods is communal, the resources of the communal space are shared. Management and maintenance is provided on behalf of the whole establishment as opposed to by the individual integrated units. Site management is responsible for the overall cleanliness, safety, and security of the communal space, while the individual outlets will be responsible internally for their business units.

Consumers have a scope of choice in relation to their diet and preferences. The choice of outlets is good for variety, especially for customers whose employers are situated near the food court, and food courts are commonly situated near to high density business centres due to this, as well as shopping malls and entertainment centres.

==Criticisms==

Food courts provide the consumer with variety of food, but this does not mean the variety of companies that provide it is directly proportional. Due to the fact food courts are located in central areas, the high density of custom and money means the value and demand of the food court is great.

Hence, there will usually be a premium cost for renting a business unit in a food court, which restricts the outlets to companies with the most financial and marketing power. This is why one will find more [[Burger King]]s, [[KFC]]s, [[McDonalds]], and [[Pizza Hut]]s inside a food court more often than smaller chains of fast service food outlets.
