A '''food court''' is a type of indoor plaza contiguous with the counters of multiple food vendors and providing a common area for self-serve dining. In the [[United States]], food courts became popular in the [[1980s]] in [[shopping mall]]s and [[airport]]s. Food courts are sometimes found in other tourist areas, such as [[Quincy Market]] in downtown [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], a historic market that has been entirely converted to a indoor food court. 

Food courts usually (but not always) consist of several small counters of [[fast food]] outlets, sometimes with more upscale restaurants may be located nearby.  Some current [[U.S.]] fast food chains consist entirely or primarily of food court outlets (notably [[Chic-fil-a]] and [[Cinnabon]]) but food courts may also contain outlets of more conventional fast-food outlets such as [[Burger King]]. 

At a typical food court, patrons order their meals at one of the many counters, then carry the meal to the common dining area on a standardized tray. 

The common dining area is located in area with a vaulted ceiling or skylights in order to provide a roomier atmosphere with better illumination.
