A '''food court''' is a part of a [[shopping mall]] reserved for food vendors.

Food courts usually (but not always) consist of several small counters of [[fast food]] outlets with a common seating area shared by all.  Sometimes more upscale restaurants may be located nearby.  Some current [[U.S.]] fast food chains consist entirely or primarily of food court outlets (notably [[Chic-fil-a]] and [[Cinnabon]]) but food courts may also contain outlets of more conventional fast-food outlets such as [[Burger King]].
