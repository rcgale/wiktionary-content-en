<BR>Recipe<BR>  
<BR> 
1.75 oz Cachaça <BR> 
1/2 Fresh Tahiti Lime<BR> 
1 - 2 teaspoons superfine cane sugar<BR> 
Crushed ice<BR> 
<BR> 
Cut off the ends of the lime and cut it into eight even wedges. Be sure to remove the white core. Sprinkle the sugar over 4 lime slices in the bottom of an old-fashioned glass. With a wood pestle; press only the core of the fruit, without pressing the rind. This prevents the drink from becoming sour. Fill the glass with crushed ice and add Cachaça. Shake or stir well.
