===Noun===
#A superior force of voice or of articulative effort upon some particular syllable of a word or a phrase, distinguishing it from the others.
#:'''Note:''' Many English words have two accents, the ''primary'' and the ''secondary''; the primary being uttered with a greater stress of voice than the secondary; as in ''as<b>'</b>pira<b>"</b>tion'', where the chief stress is on the third syllable, and a slighter stress on the first. Some words, as ''an<b>'</b>tiap<b>'</b>o-plec<b>"</b>tic'', ''in-com<b>'</b>pre-hen<b>'</b>si-bil<b>"</b>i-ty'', have two secondary accents. 
#A mark or character used in writing, and serving to regulate the pronunciation; especially:
#:(a) a mark to indicate the nature and place of the spoken accent;
#:(b) a mark to indicate the quality of sound of the vowel marked; as, the French '''accents'''
#:'''Note:''' In the ancient Greek the '''acute accent''' (<b>&#180;</b>) meant a raised tone or pitch, the '''grave''' (<b>&#0096</b>), the level tone or simply the negation of accent, the '''circumflex''' (<b>~</b> or <b>^</b>) a tone raised and then depressed. In works on elocution, the first is often used to denote the rising inflection of the voice; the second, the falling inflection; and the third (^), the compound or waving inflection. In dictionaries, spelling books, and the like, the acute accent is used to designate the syllable which receives the chief stress of voice.
