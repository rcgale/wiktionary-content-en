===Noun phrase===
'''[[false]] [[friend]]'''
# A word in a foreign language bearing a deceptive resemblance to a word in one's own language. Mistranslating such words can cause serious problems. For example:
#:The French ''nous demandons'' means "we ask", but sounds like "we demand", which can turn negotiation into confrontation.
#:The Spanish word ''embarazada'' means "pregnant", not "embarrassed" &mdash; "Estoy embarazada" means "I am pregnant," not "I am embarrassed".
#:The German word ''will'' (want) is not a future tense marker &mdash; "Ich will gehen" means "I want to go," not "I will go".
