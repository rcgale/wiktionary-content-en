===Idiomatic expression===
False friends (a.k.a. '''false cognates''') are pairs of words in two languages that look or sound similar but differ in meaning. Such words can cause difficulty for students learning a foreign language because the students are likely to misidentify the words based on knowledge of their native language.

===Examples===
#The German word 'will' and the English word 'will'
#A Dutch person was told that an English speaking visitor to his company bred horses. When he met the visitor they had a little chat, and at one moment the host remarked: "So, I hear you fuck horses." (Dutch fokken = English to breed) - from a true story related by a Wiktionarian.
