# Literally '''Old Man Frost''', this is the bearded white-haired old man who brings Christmas presents, essentially [[Santa Claus]], but not completely. The figure of Dedo Mráz was introduced during the Communist era as an atheist replacement Christmas figure, but it ended up to become an addition to the existing figures of St. Nicholas (Dec. 6) and Baby Jesus (Dec. 23).
