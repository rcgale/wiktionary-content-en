==English==
#Pronounced like: etch (except with a "bl" in front)

===Verb===
#To have the vomiting reflex triggered.  A very technical term used to express disfavor towards something posted by a fellow subscriber, and often appears in mailing list forums, such as the Progress Email Group (www.peg.com).

===Common Variations===
#Blecccchhh!
#Blecccccccchhhhhhhhh!!!
#[Any repeating series of c, h, and !, in sequence, is allowed. Repeating the e is not acceptable, because then it might sound like bleach. And while bleach would certainly cause vomiting, that is something altogether different.]
