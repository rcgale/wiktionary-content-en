A '''crossword''' puzzle is (usually) a [[square]] or [[rectangle]] (but sometimes other shapes are used) which is marked off into a [[grid]], in which individual 

*[[letters are placed, such that the words used cross over each other.  The words to be used are based on clues given by the writer of the puzzle, and are inserted into the squares corresponding to the number given for the clue.
