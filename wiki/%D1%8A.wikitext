#The twenty-eighth letter of the Russian [[Cyrillic]] alphabet is named '''твёрдый знак''' (tvjórdyj znak, or "hard sign"). It has no sound of its own, but modifies that of the preceding consonant, causing it to be pronounced hard (i.e., unpalatalized). It is preceded by [[щ|Щ]] and followed by [[ы|Ы]].
#The twenty-seventh letter of the Bulgarian [[Cyrillic]] alphabet is named '''ер голям''' (er goljam, or "big er"). It has the sound ø. It is preceded by [[щ|Щ]] and followed by [[ь|Ь]].
