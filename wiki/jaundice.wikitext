===Etymology===
Old English ''[[jaunis]]'', French ''[[jaunisse]]'', from ''[[jaune]]'' yellow, originally ''[[jalne]]'', from Latin ''[[galbinus]]'' yellowish, from ''[[galbus]]'' yellow
===Noun===
#''(Medicine):'' A morbid condition, characterized by yellowness of the [[eye]]s, [[skin]], and [[urine]], whiteness of the feces, [[constipation]], [[queasiness]], loss of [[appetite]], and general [[languor]] and [[lassitude]]. It is caused usually by [[obstruction]] of the [[biliary passage]]s and consequent [[damming up]], in the liver, of the bile, which is then absorbed into the [[blood]]. Other causes include increased [[hemolysis]] and any [[liver]] [[disease]]. The discoloration is caused by accumulation of [[bilirubin]] in the body; bilirubin is normally excreted in [[bile]] to give [[feces]] their normal yellow-brown coloration.
