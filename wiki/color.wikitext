=== Alternative spelling===
*[[colour]] ''(Commonwealth English)''
'''Note''' - The spelling "color" is primarily a US usage.  Originally the spelling of 'colour' without a U was a sanctioned change of the Spelling Reformist Movement, which was not exclusively accepted by Americans, but was much more popular in the US than it was elsewhere. When the movement died out, its changes remained in US English but not in International English.

=== Etymology ===
From Old French '''[[coulour]]''', from Latin '''color'''.  In American spelling the 'u' was dropped from [[colour]] to simplify the spelling. In British spelling the 'u' remains.
