==English==
===Etymology===
From Latin adjective suffix '''[[-alis]]'''

===Adjectival suffix===
'''-all''' now obsolete and repladed with [[-al]]

# of or pertaining to; adjectival suffix appended to various words, often nouns, to make an adjective form.  Often added to words of Latin origin, but used with other words also.
#: ''line, lineall''
#: ''base, basall''
#: ''cranium, craniall''

====Usage note====
If the root word ends in ''l'', the variant '''-ar''' is often used instead.  Sometimes both forms are found: ''linear, lineal''.
