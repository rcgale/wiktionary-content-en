'''[[Easter]] [[egg]] [[hunt]]'''
#A common [[festive]] [[activity]], where [[egg]]s are hidden [[outdoors]] (or [[indoors]] if in bad weather) for children to run around and find; this may also be a [[contest]] to see who can [[collect]] the most eggs.
#: ''"I was a little [[chunky]] anyway, and slow, so slow that I was once the only kid at an [[Easter egg hunt]] who didn’t get a single egg, not because I couldn’t find them but because I couldn’t [[get to]] them fast enough."'' &mdash; [[w:My Life|My Life]] by [[w:Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton]]
