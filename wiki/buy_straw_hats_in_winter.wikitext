'''Buy straw hats in winter''' is a saying, often in reference to the [[stock market]], that one should buy something while it is out of favor because eventually it will be in favor and the price will be higher.  Specifically, no one wants a straw hat during the winter time, and therefore the price should be low.  But as summer approaches, more people need straw hats and therefore they will be in higher demand, and the price will be higher.
