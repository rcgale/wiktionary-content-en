===Etymology===
Possibly related to an ancient Egyptian (possibly Persian and Middle Eastern also) belief that a pair of [[dog]]s - hounds of the Dark Goddess [[Hekat]] (Greek: [[Hecate]]) guarded the gates to the underworld.  

It is said that the body of [[King Henry VIII]] was taken to [[Syon House]] in [[Brentford]].  During the night the [[coffin]] popped open, and servants found dogs licking the remains. 

In Britain during times when bodies weren't buried or [[cremate]]d, it is known that bodies were fed to dogs.

===Verb===
'''gone to the dogs''' (goes to the dogs, go to the dogs, going to the dogs)
# to have fallen into [[disrepair]] or [[ruin]]; to have been [[stagnant]] or [[depreciate]]d
#: ''This company has '''gone to the dogs''' ever since the CEO was replaced.''
