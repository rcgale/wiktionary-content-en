Possibly related to an ancient Egyptian (possibly Persian and Middle Eastern also) belief that a pair of dogs - hounds of the Dark Goddess Hekat (Greek: Hecate) guarded the gates to the underworld.  

It is said that the body of King Henry VIII was taken to Syon House in Brentford.  During the night the coffin popped open, and servents found dogs licking the remains. 

In Britain during times when bodies weren't buried or cremated, it is known that bodies were fed to dogs.
