'''body''' (plural: [[bodies]])

#The physical representation of a [[human]] or [[animal]].  The Latin word for body is ''corpus''.  A [[dead]] body can be called a '''corpse''' (human) or '''carcass''' (animal).
#A held-together collection or group of physical objects or abstract ideas.  Sometimes the Latin word [[corpus]] is also used for such a collection.  This meaning of the word is derived from (1) because the human body is considered a whole which is of greater value than the sum of the value of the individual [[member]]s.  (Note the double meaning of the word member.)
#:a collected ''body'' of knowledge.
#(Car): bodywork.
