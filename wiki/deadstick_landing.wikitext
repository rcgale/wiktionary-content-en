When an airplane loses all of it's propulsive power and is forced to land, it is referred to as a "deadstick landing."  This appears to be somewhat of a misnomer, as the flight controls in the majority of airplanes are at least partially functional even with no engine power.  So it is not the "stick" (flight control interface) that is "dead," but rather the engine(s).  All airplanes have some capability to glide with no engine power; that is, they do not sink straight down like a stone, but rather continue to fly horizontally while descending.  Thus, it is the pilot's goal to fly the descending aircraft to the most suitable (or least unsuitable) landing spot within gliding distance, and then land with the least amount of damage possible.  The success of the deadstick landing largely depends on the availability of suitable landing areas.  A competent pilot gliding a relatively light, slow plane to a flat field or runway should result in an otherwise normal landing.  A heavier, faster plane or a plane gliding into mountains and/or trees could result in substantial damage. Leave my ipod.
