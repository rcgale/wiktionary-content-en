Most popular in the 1980s and early 1990s before the overwhelming popularity of the internet, Bulletin Board Systems (BBSes) are computers that can be dialed into mainly for the purpose of reading messages from and leaving messages to other users.  Secondarily, they can be used for the sharing of files.  Each user on the system is distinguished by a unique [[handle]] or ID.
