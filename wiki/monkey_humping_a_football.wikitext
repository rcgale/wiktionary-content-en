===Usage Note===
The phrase is generally but not exclusively used in simile, e.g.,  ''I'm busier than a monkey humping a football.'' or ''You look like a monkey humping a football.'' The riding position may also be used attributively, as ''I switched to a monkey humping a football position'', in which case it is generally hyphenated: ''I switched to a monkey-humping-a-football position.''  The plural form, [[monkeys humping a football]] has somewhat different usage.  In particular, it lacks the riding sense.
