==English==

===Usage Note===
The use of this word to refer to a black person is normally considered pejorative.  The word is, however, used by some black people as a neutral or even affirmative term.  When used by someone who is not black, it is almost invariably considered offensive. In its pejorative sense, it arguably ranks as the most offensive and insulting racial/ethnic term in English, carrying with it strong connotations of cultural, aesthetic, and intellectual inferiority.  Changing attitudes and realizations towards those of black origin (e.g., realizing that blacks are not intellectually inferior to other races; acknowledgement of highly significant cultural contributions made by blacks) has made the writing of this word taboo in many instances, or if it is written, it is often obfuscated as "N_____", "N****r", etc.

===Noun===

# (normally offensive, often considered vulgar, but see usage note) a usually dark-skinned African or person of African descent.
# figuratively, by extension, any oppressed group (e.g. "Woman is the nigger of the world", "The Irish are the niggers of Europe").
