===Usage Note===
The use of this word to refer to a black person is considered pejorative.  The word is, however, used by some black people as a neutral or even affirmative term.  When used by someone who is not black, it is almost invariably considered offensive. 

===Noun===
# (normally offensive, but see usage note) a usually dark-skinned African or person of African descent.
# figuratively, by extension, any oppressed group (e.g. "Woman is the nigger of the world", "The Irish are the niggers of Europe").
