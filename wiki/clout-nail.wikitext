===Quotations===
*'''1866''': They must have been light, for, reckoned by the hundred, the average is not very different from that of the hundred-weight of iron; and clout-nails must have been of moderate size, as the value varies very little from that of horseshoe-nails. &mdash; James Edwin Thorold Rogers, ''A History of Agriculture and Prices in England'', Volume 1, p. 546.
