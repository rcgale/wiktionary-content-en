PYO refers to pick-your-own farms, a commercial agritourism / agri-entertainment strategy that has been around for decades, but has grown dramatically in the the 90's.

The farmer grows the crops and when the crop is ready for harvest, opens the fields to the public (under some form of supervision). The customer picks whatever they want, and brings it to a checkout stand for weighing and payment. The fees are typically %50 or less of grocery store prices for equivalent quantities. Containers are usually supplied by the farm, sometimes for a nominal fee.

The appeal of pickyourown farms is:

1. freshest possible vegetables and fruit 2. lower cost 3. fun, family activity that s in a safe, outdoor environment

Prior to the advent of the Internet, locating a PYO farm was difficult, as most farmers are poor marketers. Google provides both links to farms websites, directly, and links to lists of farms; search on "pick your own farms" or "PYO farms".

Synonyms: U-pick farms, U-pickit farms
