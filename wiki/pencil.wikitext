===[[Noun]]===

#Writing utensil that uses [[led]] or [[graphite]].  Regular pencils usually have a graphite shaft surrounded by wood.  A pencil sharpener is used to cut away the wood and leave a fine tip on the pencil.  Also available in a [[mechanical]] version where the graphite length can be adjusted and sharpening is not needed.  Commonly has an [[eraser]] on the non-writing end.
