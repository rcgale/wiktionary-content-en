===Adjective===
'''supernatural'''

# above [[nature]]; that which is beyond or added to nature, often so considered because it is given by God or some force beyond that which humans are born with.  In Roman Catholic theology, [[sanctifying grace]] is considered to be a supernatural addition to human nature.
