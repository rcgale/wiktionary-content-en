'''ACC'''

#American Chemistry Council
#''Author Created Character'', [[Internet]] [[slang]], referring to the practice of creating a new character wholesale who is added into a [[fanfic]]'s cast of 'official' characters. (The characters created by the official original creator are not considered ACC.) The practice is generally discouraged unless the character plays a small role and never overtakes the existing characters' importance in a story; those that do are often accused of being "Mary Sues" or "Self Inserts".
