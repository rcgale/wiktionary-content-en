        <Japanese> The cursive formed Japanese kana syllabary.
        Hiragana is mostly used for grammatical particles,
        verb-inflection, and Japanese words which are not written in
        kanji or which are too difficult for an educated person to
        read or write in kanji.  Hiragana are also used for
        [[furigana]].
