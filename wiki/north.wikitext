==Pronunciation==
:[[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: /nɔːθ/ or /noːɻθ/
:[[SAMPA]]: /nO:T/ or /no:r\`T/

==Etymology==
From the [[Anglo-Norman]], ''norht'', derived from the Old French, ''north'' or ''nort''. Originally from a Germanic word, though unclear what that originally was. Cognates of that time included, Danish ''nord'', Old Saxon, ''north'', Old High German, ''nort'' so it should have been similar. It is thought that prior to this, there is an [[Indo-European]] root similar to the Greek word, ''nerteros'', which meant "lower" and the Umbrian ''nertu'' which meant "left". Since sacrifices were made towards the east, altars would be left and lower in terms of the sun's position high in the south at noon.


==Noun==
# One of the four major [[compass point]]s.  When facing [[east]], north is on the [[left]].  Maps are usually drawn with the north pointing upwards.
