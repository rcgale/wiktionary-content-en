Indicating an incredibly huge amount.

The word is derived from the word Gargantua which was first used in the sixteenths century French novels of Rabelais ("Gargantua" and "Pantagruel"), Gargantua being the eponymous character of an "enormous giant" with a voracious appetite. Due to the cultural impact of the novels the words "Gargantuesque" and "Gargantuen" entered the French language as an analogy to the incredible magnitude of Gargantua's appetite (as a baby he drank daily the milk of 17900 cows).

The novels are available on the web in the original old French. For
