Note: when trying to submit this article to wikipedia I mistakenly submitted it to wiktionary (which I hadn't heard of before) where it seems out of place but I do not know how to delete it so I am adding this text in front so that a more knowledgeable person on the wiktionary project can take the appropriate action (and maybe add a "How to delete a page" page similar to the "How to start a page" page and add to the "Most Common Faux Pas" page by explaining how to correct it when we do it).

I am sorry for the inconvenience that I have caused.

======= original text of the page =======
French word indicating an incredibly huge proportion.

The word is derived from the word Gargantua which was first used in the sixteenths century French novels of Rabelais ("Gargantua" and "Pantagruel"), Gargantua being the eponymous character of an "enormous giant" with a voracious appetite. Part of the impact of the novels on French culture are the words "gargantuesque" and "gargantuen"* which entered the French language as an analogy to the incredible magnitude of Gargantua's appetite (for example as a baby he drank daily the milk produced by 17900 cows).

The novels are available on the web in the original old French. For
