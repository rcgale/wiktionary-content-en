'''Entopic''' is an [[adjective]] with at least two meanings. First, it can mean "in the usual place" to refer to [[medical]] or [[anatomical]] objects. It is in distinction to ''[[ectopic]]'', which means "not in the usual place" (such as an [[ectopic pregnancy]]. In an [[Ovid]] search of [[Index Medicus]] and [[PsychINFO]] conducted on 2005 April 20, there were 36 instances of ''entopic,'' of which 14 were in its medical sense.

Second, it can mean [[entoptic phenomenon|entoptic]], that is "visible because of something within the eye". In the same Ovid search, there were 22 instances of this meaning, mainly from [[Psychology]] [[journal]]s. In four cases, both ''entopic'' and ''entoptic'' were used in the same reference, suggesting that ''entopic'' is a [[typographical error]] that has taken on a life of its own.
