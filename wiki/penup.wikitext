'''Penup''' is the stage during the process of handwriting after a [[pen lift]] event, where the pen-tip hovers above the writing pad, before a [[Pendown]] landing. [[Electromagnetic]] [[digitizer]]s, unlike pressure-sensitive pads, are able to deliver an estimated coordinate position of the pen tip.

Some [[digitizer]]s are even able to provide an estimate of the height of the pen tip during the [[Penup]] [[trajectory]].
