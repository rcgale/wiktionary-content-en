Penup is the stage during the process of handwriting after a [[pen lift]] event, where the pen-tip hovers above the writing pad, before a Pendown landing. Electromagnetic [[digitizers]], unlike pressure-sensitive pads, are able to deliver an estimated X,Y position of the pen tip.
Some [[digitizers]] are even able to provide an estimate of the height of the pen tip during the [[Penup]] [[trajectory]].
