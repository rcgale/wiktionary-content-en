===Adjective===
'''contiguous'''
# [[connected|Connected]], [[touching]], [[adjacent]], [[abut]]ting.

===Usage note===
A common missuse of the term ''contiguous'' is to refer to the 48 [[conterminous]] states of the United States of America as being ''contiguous.''  However, [[New York State]] does not physically touch the state of [[California]], nor does it share any borders with it.  [[Washington]] is not adjacent to [[Florida]], [[Texas]] does not abut [[Maine]], etc.
