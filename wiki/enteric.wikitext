'''Usage note:''' occasionally, tablets, pills and other pharmaceuticals will be designated 'enterically coated' or something similar to indicate that they're designed to pass through the stomach undigested and into the intestines where they're broken down.  This is done to alleviate nausea and related symptoms when certain substances are absorbed in the stomach.
