==Actual Occasions==
Coined by [[wikipedia:Alfred North Whitehead|Alfred North Whitehead]], and also called ''Actual entities'', these are the final real things in the universe, and are "experiential" in nature rather than strictly material.  They are the most basic thing or construct in the universe.  Some Whitehead scholars would hold that trillions of Actual Occassions comprise one [[wikipedia:quark|quark]].  Actual occasions make up everything, even empty space:  "Actual entities--also termed Actual Occassions--are the final real things of which the world is made up.  There is no going behind actual entities to find anything more real. ...The final facts are, all alike, actual entities; and these actual entities are drops of experience, complex and interdependent."
