The ''telecottage'' is the name given to the teleworker's physical workplace.  The ''telecottage'' can be in the individual's home or, as is becoming increasingly the case, on a communal site within a short walking distance of the teleworker's home.

The degree of technology employed in a ''telecottage'' depends on the teleworker's duties and overall resources.  For example, a self-employed teleworking architect could work from an office which has nothing more than a drawing desk and a fax.  However whilst the teleworker's paraphernalia can be limited, certain economies can be counterproductive especially if these home-based workers are unable to compete due to shortcomings in their equipment.  It is therefore no surprise to learn that the bulk of teleworking is centring on PC-based systems.
