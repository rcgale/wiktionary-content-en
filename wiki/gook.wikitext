==English==
===Etymology===
Probably from ''Hangook'', the Korean term for Korea.

===Noun===
'''gook''' ([[gooks]])

#A derogatory term for Koreans.
#A derogatory term for east asians and southeast asians.

Usage note: In the US this refers particularly to Vietnamese in the context of the Vietnam war, and particularly to the Viet Cong.  It is generally considered highly offensive, on a par with [[nigger]].  In a highly charged and nuanced incident, Senator John McCain famously used the word publically to refer specifically to his former captors, then apologized in deference to the Vietnamese community at large.
