'''Crypto-revisionism''' is a derogatory term used to describe the act of engaging in [[historical revisionism]] for primarily political purposes. The term "crypto" is intended to refer to the use of obscure, little-known (or misunderstood) reasoning and overblown statements in order to hide the true intent behind the author's actions (in the same sense that [[cryptography]] is used to hide a secret message from prying eyes).

The term "crypto-revisionism" is usually used in public circles in a demeaning manner. Authors often use the term as a way of suggesting that their opponents are trying to hide the truth and bury it with muddling, distracting facts that are actually unrelated to the subject at hand.
