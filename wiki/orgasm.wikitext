Orgasm is the climax or peak which occurs during sexual activity. It generally involves a momentary feeling of intense pleasure for the person experiencing it. Both genders of the human species can experience orgasm. In males, orgasm involves a series of muscular contractions of the prostate gland. The male orgasm is often but not always characterized by the emission, or ejaculation of semen from the penis. Semen contains sperm, which are the reproductive cells produced by the male testicle. After orgasm, the male penis generally becomes soft and the male cannot achieve another orgasm for several minutes -- this time period is known as the refractory period. The female orgasm is a series of contractions of the uterus. It is generally accepted that males achieve orgasm with less effort. Females tend to take longer to achieve orgasm, but theirs are said to be more intense. In addition, some women have found they can achieve multiple orgasms in short succession. Some women experience an emission of fluid during orgasm though doctors disagree as to its source or value.
