# (''United Kingdom English, primarily Geordie and Scottish English'') jog, hit, punch


=== Noun ===
'''dunch'''
# (''Golf'') a fat hit from a claggy lie
# a small meal between lunch and dinner in the late afternoon or early evening (about 3-5 p.m.), usually including tea or coffee with cookies, sometimes fruits, a salad or a light sandwich.
#:'''examples'''
#:*"For tomorrow, I have already scheduled lunch and dinner with my colleagues. Let's have a '''dunch''' together."
#:'''usage note'''
#:*This is a more appropriate word for an intermediate meal than the once suggested "linner". Dunch, a small meal, is more similar to lunch than to dinner, and accordingly the word is more brief (one syllable). Also, the word "dunch" follows the pattern of naming another intermediate (or combined) meal - "brunch."

=== Proper noun ===
'''Dunch'''
# a [[family name]]
