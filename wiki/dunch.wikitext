dunch n (blend of "lunch" and "dinner"; cf. brunch) - a small meal between lunch and dinner in the late afternoon or early evening (about 3- 5 pm.).

This is a more appropriate word for an intermediate meal that once suggested "linner," because it is more similar to lunch than to dinner and is more brief (one syllable). It also follows the model of the  neologism for another intermediate (or combined) meal - "brunch."

Dunch usually includes tea or coffee with cookies, sometimes a sandwich.

Example:
For tomorrow, I have already scheduled lunch and dinner with my colleagues.  Let's have a dunch  together.
