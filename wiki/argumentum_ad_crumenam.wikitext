'''Argumentum ad crumenam''' is a [[logical fallacy]] of thinking a conclusion is correct because the person making the argument is rich.

:Example:
:''If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?
:''I think Mary is a good role model. She's pretty rich so she must be doing something right.''

The opposite is the [[argumentum ad lazarum]].
