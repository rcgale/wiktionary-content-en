===Noun phrase===
'''[[dolphin]] [[hugger]]''' (''plural'' '''dolphin huggers''')

#(''derogatory'') An [[environmentalist]] who is considered to be too [[earnest]].

<!-- Initial definition, which I (Paul G) dispute:
Term used by scientists and academics referring to early career would-be marine biologists. Particularly, this applies to people that are studying marine biology to be dolphin trainers, and are not seriously interested in studying science. Note: this term carries a strong negative connotation. 

“Oy, I have a marine biology class full of dolphin huggers.”
