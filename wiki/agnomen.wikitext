An '''Agnomen''' is a [[nickname]] or an [[alias]]. It is ''not'' a [[pseudonym]] as it is a real name. But an agnomen is usually a name in ''[[addition]]'' and not a ''[[substitution]]'' for the real name. For example, [[Aristides the Just|Aristides "the Just"]] or [[Mike Tyson|"Iron" Mike Tyson]].

Agnomens like "Britannicus" or "Nero" were used in ancient [[Rome]] to distinguish between similarly-named members of a family, or to honour of impressive accomplishments. For example, [[Coriolanus]] earned his from the capture of [[Coroli]].  See [[Roman naming convention#Agnomen|Roman naming convention]].
