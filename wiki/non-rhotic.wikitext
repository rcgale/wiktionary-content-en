==English==
===Etymology===
[[non]] + [[rhotic]]

===Adjective===
'''non-rhotic'''

#Of an English accent, not pronouncing the letter ''r'' when it occurs at the end of a word or before a consonant, as in ''bar'' ([[w:IPA|IPA]] /bɑː/) and ''bard'' or ''barred'' (IPA /bɑːd/), but pronouncing it before a vowel, as in ''barrow'' (IPA /ˈbærəʊ/); this trait is common in the accents of the south of England; Australia; New Zealand; New York; and Boston.  <!--Note: semicolons used here so that this cannot be misinterpreted as "the south of England, the south of Australia, etc" -->

:Non-rhotic areas tend to add an ''r'' ([[intrusive r]]) between words when one word ends in a vowel and the following word begins with a vowel; example: ''Canastota Airport'' becomes ''Canastoter Airport''.
