'''dieselpunk''' (''no [[comparative]] or [[superlative]]'')

#Of or having a [[fictional]] [[setting]] in which [[steam power]] and [[medieval]] [[technology]] [[coexist]].

Dieselpunk is a genre of books, games, and art spun off from the [[cyberpunk]] movement of the 1980s. Related genres include [[steampunk]], clockpunk, and magipunk. At their worst, these terms are mere catchphrases and empty hype; at their best, all these genres aim to bring a fresh, anarchic, [[punk rock]] sensibility to [[speculative fiction]] and games.

The term dieselpunk was first coined for the [[Children of the Sun]] tabletop [[role-playing game]]. In the game, mechanization, firearms, and radios exist in a fantastic world of magic. The most notable dieselpunk books are the works of [[China Mieville]].
