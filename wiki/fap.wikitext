===Etymology===

Originally from the English translation of the [[manga]] "Heartbreak Angels", presumably from Japanese [[onomatopoeia]]. Popularized by strip #003 of the online comic "Sexy Losers" by Hard. The strip and an explanation can be seen at [http://sexylosers.com/003.html] (warning, may be offensive).

===Pronunciation===

*(US) [[w:IPA|IPA]]: /f√¶p/

===Verb===

'''to fap'''

# (of males) to [[masturbate]] (chiefly Internet slang)

====Usage====

Because of the term's [[onomatopoeic]] nature, it can only be used when referring to a male. Hard later coined [[shlick]] as the female counterpart but its usage is not nearly as widespread.

The inflected forms "fapping" and "fapped" always use a doubled "p".

Combined forms such as [[fappable]], [[faptastic]], and [[fapworthy]] have been sighted.
