====Usage====

Because of the term's [[onomatopoeic]] nature, it can only be used when referring to a male. Hard later coined [[shlick]] as the female counterpart but its usage is not nearly as widespread.

The usage "fap to x" refers to x as what one is watching or thinking of while fapping, e.g. "He fapped to the latest Britney Spears video" or "I fapped to the thought of [[sexual intercourse|getting lucky]] with Susie"

The inflected verb forms "fapping" and "fapped" always use a doubled "p".

Combined forms such as [[fappable]], [[faptastic]], and [[fapworthy]] have been sighted.
