'''Aspirin''' (pronounced "ahh-spihr-ehn"), also known as ''[[salycilic acid]]'' is a [[drug]] which is obtained from the bark of the [[willow]] tree.  Originally, 'aspirin' was a trademark of the [[Bayer]] company, but as a result of their failing to protect it from use as a generic term, it became generic in the United States.  It is still a trademark in some countries such as Great Britain.
