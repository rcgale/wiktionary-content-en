===Quotations===
'''2005:''' I used to be a master of the groupetto, but it has been many years since I’ve been forced to ride in a bona fide, terminally dropped group. It’s strange to be back. Riding in the groupetto requires a different mentality and skill set. &mdash; Bradley McGee in [http://www.tourdefrancenews.com/tourdefrance/experts/columns/0,5976,s1-12599-527-expert,00.html Riding in the Groupetto]
