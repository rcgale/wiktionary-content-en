== Chiral ==
Chiral molecules are mirrored images of each other ([[isomeres]]), which -due to their molecular configuration- become unique and cannot be superimposed on each other, as opposed to achiral molecules.<br>
Chiral, pronounced ki-rul, is derived from the Greek work meaning "hand." The two mirror image versions of the molecule are known as "levo" (left-handed), abbreviated "L," or "dextro" (right handed), abbreviated "D," depending on which way they rotate polarized light.
