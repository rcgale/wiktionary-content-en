'''Quiche eater''' is a derogatory term in [[computer programming]] circles, implying that the target of the accusation is too far removed from practice and is more part to academic matters, unwilling to "get their hands dirty". Being humorous in nature, it is usually a fairly mild insult.

It was popularised by the [[1983]] article "''Real Programmers Don't Use [[Pascal programming language|PASCAL]]''" by [[Ed Post]] [http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~kensmith/rpgm.txt]. The title itself derives from the title of the [[1982]] book "''[[Real Men Don't Eat Quiche]]''" by [[Bruce Feirstein]].

The article specifically accuses the creator of Pascal, [[Niklaus Wirth]], of being a "quiche eater", and is generally a tongue-in-cheek bashing of the philosophy underlying Pascal (and by extension, other [[high-level programming language]]s).
