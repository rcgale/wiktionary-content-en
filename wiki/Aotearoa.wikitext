==Maori and New Zealand English==

===Etymology===
From [[Maori]]. Literal translation: "Long White Cloud" (''ao'' = cloud, ''tea'' = white, ''roa'' = long). Frequently mistranslated as "''The land of'' the long white cloud", even though no part of it means "the land of". Probably a reference to the appearance of mountanous land when seen on the horizon from a canoe after an ocean voyage. Came into use in the early-mid 20th century.
