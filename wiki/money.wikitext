The medium of exchange by which things are bought and sold in a non-[[barter]] society. Before the widespread use of paper money, money was usually made out of precious elements such as gold, platinum and silver. In a modern society money can be paper not even based on precious metals. Increasingly, most societies are slowly migrating away from even paper and towards binary values stored in databases.
