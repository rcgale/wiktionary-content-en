In the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, the P45 is the form that a person is handed when leaving a job. The P45 details income for social security purposes. (The two countries' respective P45s are actually different; it's just that the UK and Ireland have very similar administrative processes here.) 

Use of the term "P45" depends on context. See the following examples:

to be given your P45 -- to get fired (possibly unceremoniously) 

to ask for your P45 -- to quit your job (possibly unceremoniously and/or defiantly) 

to be in possession of your P45 -- to be jobless 
(The P45 is handed to the employer when starting at the next job.)
