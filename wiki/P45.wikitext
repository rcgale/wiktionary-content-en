'''P45'''
# In the [[Republic of Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]], the P45 is the [[form]] that a person [[receives]] when [[leaving]] [[employment]]. The P45 details income for [[social security]] purposes. (The two countries' respective P45s are actually different; it's just that the UK and Ireland have very similar administrative processes here.)

===Note===
# To be given a P45 is to be [[sacked]] from [[employment]]
# To ask for a P45 is to [[resign]] from [[employment]]
# To be in [[possession]] of your P45 is to be without [[employment]]
