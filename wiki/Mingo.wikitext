# '''Mingo''' is a [[polysynthetic]] language of the Northern [[w:Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]] language family. It was once spoken across eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. At present, fewer than five fluent speakers of Mingo remain, but there has been increasing interest in recent years in revitalizing the language.
