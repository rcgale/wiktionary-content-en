#An administrative region of various countries, including [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Croatia]], [[France]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Serbia and Montenegro]] and [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]].
#An equivalent geographic region without administrative functions, as in '''[[traditional county]]''.
