'''Backlog'''
# The effect on the business of a build-up of work that occurs as the result of a system or process being unavailable for an unacceptable period. A situation whereby a backlog of work requires more time to action than is available through normal working patterns. In extreme circumstances, the backlog may become so marked that the backlog cannot be cleared.
