The term '''city fathers''' is used in the United States as a municipal version of "[[Founding Fathers]]." City fathers are usually those men (and once in a while, women) who founded the city and/or its major institutions. The term can be used to describe contemporary city leaders as well.

One notable example from fiction is [[List_of_recurring_characters_from_The_Simpsons#Jebediah_Springfield|Jebediah Springfield]] of ''[[The Simpsons]].'' The Daley family of [[Chicago]] could be an example of city fathers from the present-day.
