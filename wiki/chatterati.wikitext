'''Chatterati''' is a [[journalistic]] [[slang]] word that conflates the term [[chattering classes]] with [[litterati]] and [[glitterati]] (both arising from -rati or 'elite').  It is thus commonly taken to mean the particularly influential [[opinion formers]], often city-based, among that class of people who make a habit of spreading their opinions widely; usually those who work in politics, communications, media and the arts.
