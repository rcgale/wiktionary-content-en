A practice of the prestiged (most often male) rulers of ancient Middle Eastern cultures where women (usually dispossessed/inconvenienced or slave women) were "acquired" either from other rulers or regions conquered during war.  Acquiring a concubine in ancient times was also reputedly even a commercial business with "slave merchants" in city slave-markets, who bought and sold concubines for a moderate price (via writ).

They were then thus bestowed to such rulers, who upon taking them into possession, considered them as being their own personally owned property.  Such concubine(s) then entered into a strict and often hidden private family life.  Devoted together with the other concubines, they lived solely for the purposes of providing pleasure for their Masters, and possibly breeding male heirs (sons to succeed upon the family or ruling seat).

Usually any girls born into the extended family were either arranged to be married-off into other families for reasons of extending or reinforcing political ties, or sold immediately into their own future of forced slavery.

Concubines were often considered as "subordinate" under officially-married wives of a ruler, whereas if a wife could not be relied upon to bear an heir, the concubines would move up a notch in rank and become married as a wife, if it was thought she were to bear a male heir unto her Master / ruler.
