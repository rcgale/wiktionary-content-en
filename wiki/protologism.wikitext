==English==

===Etymology===

Coined by Mikhail Epstein (and adopted by the Wiktionary community) from Greek ''protos'', first + Greek ''logos'', word, by analogy with [[prototype]] and [[neologism]].

===Noun===
'''protologism'''

# {{wjargon}} A newly-created word given a definition in the hope that it will be used in that sense.
# {{wjargon}} A recently-created word in narrow use but not yet in general use.

===Note===

Please do not create articles for protologisms you would like to see in use.  Instead, please add them to [[Wiktionary:List of protologisms]].  In this context the ''first'' definition (newly-created in hopes of use) is relevant.  Wiktionary routinely allows terms with only a few recorded usages, so long as these are independent (see [[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion]] for more detail).
