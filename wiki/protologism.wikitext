PROTOLOGISM  [Greek protos, first + Greek logos, word; cf. prototype,  neologism] - a newly created word which has not yet gained any wide acceptance. It is a prototype or a hypothetical projection of a  new lexical unit before it may become current in writing or speech.  The word "protologism" proposed here and now is itself an example of a protologism. 

In contrast to protologisms, neologisms are words that have already been in public usage  by  authors other than their inventors. As soon as a protologism finds its way into newspapers and websites, journals and books, it becomes a neologism.
