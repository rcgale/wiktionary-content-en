'''Genuine Poo Pong'''


: A game played at Moorfield Junior School, Hazel Grove, by those going home for lunch between 1974 and 1978. On the last day of the summer term in 1978 James Dickinson became the final 'Genuine Poo Pong' and now holds the title for life. It should be noted that James always protested that he actually 'got' Sean Holbrook on the final day although this was not witnessed and was vigorously denied by Sean.
