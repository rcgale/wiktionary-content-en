Idiothetic literally means "self-proposition", and is used in navigation models (e.g., of a rat in a maze) as in the phrase "idiothetic cues" to indicate that path-integration was used to determine the present location instead of allothetic, or external, cues (e.g., visual or tactile). The term ideothetic is also used in psychology and is compared with ipsative and contrasted to nomothetic.
