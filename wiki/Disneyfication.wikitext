==English==

===Etymology===

From Disney (proper noun - An American coporation) + 'fy'. The term was orginally coined to describe the transformation of Times Square, New York following the opening of a Disney store in the early 1990's. Following this the [[Peep Shows|Peep Show]] and [[Striptease]] joints that had come to dominate the area in the previous decades closed down or were driven out by changes in the Zoning laws. ''Disneyfication'' is, perhaps, the commoner form. 

===Verb===

'''Disneyfy'''

#  To make something (especially a location) more acceptable or marketable by removing potentially distasteful or controversial elements, particularly at the cost of its historical nature. The term is generally perjorative and alludes to the fact that things are sometimes thought to resemble a [[theme park]] version of their original versions after being disneyfied.
