[[Scott Adams]] introduced the word '''confusopoly''' in his book [[The Dilbert Future]]. The word is a combination of [[confusion]] and [[monopoly]] (or rather [[oligopoly]]) and Adams defines it as ''"a group of companies with similar products who intentionally confuse customers instead of competing on price"''. 

Examples of industries in which confusopolies exist (according to Adams) include telephone service, insurance, mortgage loans, banking, and financial services.
