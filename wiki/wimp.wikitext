'''wimp'''

''A wimp is also a person who lacks [[confidence]], is [[irresolute]] and [[wishy-washy]].  The slang term is rumored to have come from a group of French gypsies called ''Wimps'' who were kicked out of France, then moved to England and were kicked out again, then moved to the United States.  The term was not common in the United States until the 1960s.''
