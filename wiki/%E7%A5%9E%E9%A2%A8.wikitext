*English: [[kamikaze]]

====Derived terms====
*[[神風特別攻撃隊]] (shinpū tokubetsu kōgeki tai)
*[[神風タクシー]] (kamikaze takushii)

====Notes====
*神風 is also the ultimate source of the English word [[kamikaze]], by a circuitous route. The characters appear in [[神風特別攻撃隊]], "神風 special attack unit", the name of one kamikaze unit surely named after the typhoon but given the [[Sino-Japanese]] [[reading]] "shinpū". However "shinpū" is not a word in its own right. The Japanese use the term "special attack unit" written in the abbreviated form [[特攻隊]] (tokkōtai) when referring to the WII suicide pilots.
