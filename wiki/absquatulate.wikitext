===Etymology===
Blended jocular mock-Latin word. Arose in America in the 19th century (about 1837). Probably made up of the following parts: The Latin adverb and prefix [[ab]], "away (from)", (maybe taken from [[abscond]]), the suffix -ate (maybe taken from [[perambulate]] or [[undulate]]), and the middle portion, "squatul", which might be a derivation of to [[squat]]. Obsolete by 1900.
