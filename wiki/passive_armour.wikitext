'''Passive armor''' is chemically inert and doesn't require electricity or active sensors to operate.  Any vehicle with a skin designed to protect it from external attack is considered to have passive armor.  

It is usually made of metal, ceramic, or in some cases, composites of various materials.

See also the inverse, [[Reactive Armor]].
