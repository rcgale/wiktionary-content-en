===Noun===
'''eclipse'''

A type of [[syzygy]], in which a planetary object (for example, the Moon) comes between the sun and another planetary object (for example, the Earth), resulting in a shadow being cast by the middle object onto the other object.

In a "lunar eclipse", the Earth casts its shadow onto the Moon, sometimes causing it to completely disappear from sight.  Several pre-modern myths revolve around the Moon being "swallowed" (by a serpent in the case of Aztec mythology, for example).
