===Quotations===
'''1729:''' And all astronomers agree that their periodic orbits are in the sesquiplicate proportion of the semi-diameters of their orbits; and so it manifestly appears from the following table. &mdash; Andrew Motte, translating Isaac Newton's ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica'' <!-- Note: "in the sesquiplicate ratio" means increasing as the square root of the cube, that is, as ''x<sup>3/2</sup>'', just as "in the duplicate ratio" would mean increasing as the square. -->
