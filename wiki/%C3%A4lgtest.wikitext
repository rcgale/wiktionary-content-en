==Swedish==
===Etymology===
Direct translation of the German ''[[Elchtest]]'', which denotes a test which for long has been used by Swedish motor journalist as a measure of stability of a car during evasive manouvers in relatively high speed, for example to avoid colliding with [[elks]] ([[mooses]]) crossing the road. The term was created in 1997 &mdash; after a [[w:Merzedes-Benz|Merzedes-Benz]] overturned during the test at a mere 60 [[km/h]] (less than 40 [[mph]]) &mdash; as a mockery implying that one extremely seldom or never needed to perform such manouvers in the speeds used in the test, except in "exotic" countries such as Sweden, where elks actually somtimes get onto the roads. 

The original name, used for decades, of the test had been ''[[undanmanöverprov]]'', but the new has more or less replaced it.

===Noun===
'''älgtest'''
#[[moose test]]; a test of the maximal speed a car can manage to steer free from an obstacle, such as a child or a large animal, which suddenly appears in front of the car, without the car skidding or otherwise goes out of control. ''See also [[w:Moose test|Moose test]] on Wikipedia''
