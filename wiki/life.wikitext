#The state that precedes [[death]] and follows [[birth]].
#A status given to an entity which usually fulfills at least one and usually many of the qualifications for life:
#*[[Metabolism]]
#*[[Reproduction]]
#*some type of [[movement]]
#*must be considered living by a significant contingent of the scientific community. (Primary determinant)
#*Note: fulfilling one does not necessarily make something alive, although fulfilling the last condition usually does.
#The [[inherent]] [[struggle]] against [[entropy]].
