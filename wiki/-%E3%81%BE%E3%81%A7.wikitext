'''-まで''' ([[-made]])

# [[Until]].

==== Usage note ====
[[まで]] is often combined with [[から]] (''[[kara]]'', ''from'') to provide a range of something (e.g., time or distance).  This results in a construction like　三時から五時まで (さんじからごじまで, ''san-ji kara go-ji made'', ''from 3 o'clock until 5 o'clock'').
