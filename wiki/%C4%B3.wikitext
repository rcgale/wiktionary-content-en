# a letter used in the Dutch language that strangely enough does not have a clear place in the Dutch alfabet. 

===Pronunciation===
SAMPA: /Ei/

Notes:
* when the ĳ is used on computers it is usually written as the sequence of the letters i and j: ij
* when the comination of i and j is used at the start of a sentence '''both''' letters are capitalized. Example: IJzer is een metaal (Iron is a metal)
* dictionaries usually list the ĳ as if the i and j are separate letters: hier, hij, hik
