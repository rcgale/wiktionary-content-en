'''back-formation''' (''plural'' '''back-formations''')

#A word, X, formed from another, Y, by removing the ending that would have been added had Y been formed from X.  For example, the verb ''[[burgle]]'' is a back-formation from the noun ''[[burglar]]'', formed by removing the ending ''-ar'', as if ''burglar'' were an [[agent noun]] formed by adding this ending to the verb ''burgle''.
