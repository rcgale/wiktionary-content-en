An '''Ecology block''' is a large concrete block with a groove in the bottom face and a tongue on the top face to eliminate slippage when they are stacked. There is also a steel loop on the top face to facilitate lifting. The blocks are stacked in an offset manner to create a wall for retaining earth by means of their great mass.

They are called ecology blocks because a wall built with them can be readily dismantled and the blocks reused, whereas, a solid concrete wall is destroyed when it is dismantled.
