'''Commercial off-the-shelf''' (or '''COTS''') is a term for systems which are manufactured [[commercial]]ly, and then tailored for specific uses. This is most often used in [[military]],  [[computer]] and [[robotic]] systems. COTS systems are in contrast to systems that are produced entirely and uniquely for the specific application.
