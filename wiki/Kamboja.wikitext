===Etymology===
*The tribe may have got its name from its  illustrious warrior called  ''Kamboja''. This [[warrior]] had won the prized daivi sword from king  [[Kuvalashava]] of [[Kosala]] ( MBH 12/166/77).

* [[Yasaka]] defines Kamboja as  Kambala+bhojah and Kamaniya+bhoja. As these people  enjoyed kambalas, (i.e  were Kambal.bhojas) and the beautiful or desirable (kamaniya) things  (i.e were 'kamaniya.bhojah'), hence they were called Kamboja  (Yasaka's etymology of  Kamboja,  [[Nirukuta]] 2/2).

*''Kamaniyabhoja'' of  Yasaka literally implies  ''Handsome Bhoja'' (Dr Moti Chandra).  ''Bhoja'' is an aspirated [[Sanskrit]] equivalent of  [[Iranian]] ''Boja'' and it means 'king'  (Pirat, Koenraad Elst). This suggests that Kambojas may have been so called because they were a handsome race, or else their kings were very  handsome. 

*Alternatively, Kamboja is said to have derived from ''Kam+bhoja''. The Kambojas were Lords of a region called ''Kam'' or ''Kum'' hence called Kambojas or Kambhojas (Dr H. C. Seth).
