=== Usage note ===
[[進歩]] is quite common as a verb, and it is most easily understood in relation to the English word ''progress''.  It is frequently used in reference to social progress, particularly of a technological nature, and to personal progress in a skill.  It is not generally used to refer to progress in other sorts of endeavors, such as a trip up a mountain (e.g., "Due to the blizzard, their progress was slow."), or of time in general (e.g., "As the evening progressed, the party became more chaotic.").
