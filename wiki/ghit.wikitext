====Quotations====
*'''2004''' - I'm quite baffled, in fact, that there are so few ghits (Google hits) for this search, as the idea seems so obvious. Even if you spell it without the final 's', you end up with only one extra ghit. &mdash; [http://teflsmiler.typepad.com/weblog/2004/10/searching_sue_d.html TEFL Smiler, entry for 22 October 2004]
