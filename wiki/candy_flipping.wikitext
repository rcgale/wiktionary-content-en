'''''Candy flipping''''' is a term that refers to the psychoactive experience of combining [[LSD]] and [[MDMA]] ([[ecstasy]]). The two chemicals have been used in the past in medical experiments, the former as a means for connecting to one's [[subconscious]] and the latter for achieving in the subject a feeling of emotional honesty. The two in combination allow the user to reach a psychological state in which they can freely and critically analyse their emotions, though candy flipping tends to be a purely recreational event for most people.

Both substances involved as classified as [[schedule I]] by the United States [[Department of Justice]], and being caught with either carries a potentially long jail sentence.
