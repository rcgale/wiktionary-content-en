Some wonder where this term originated, or perhaps a better question is why is it significant - perhaps it is simply that the term "has a good ring to it". Or perhaps there is something deeper going on here...

If you know, please share this with the world.

It's meaning is essentially "to get angry with someone", and is colloquial.

But there's perhaps a history to it, and we'd like to know.
