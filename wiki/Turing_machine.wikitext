A Turing Machine is the device envisioned by Alan Turing in a paper presented in London to the Mathematical Society on 28th of May 1936. Turing pictured a "Symbol-Processing-Machine" which could be said to have a certain number of states. The machine undertook a specific function at each cycle determined only by two things ; What state the machine started in , and what symbol it saw. Turing's paper presented a range of such machines and within the paper he imagined what he called the "Universal Computing Machine" essentially a single Turing machine that could imitate all other Turing machines and duplicate their actions.

The importance of this paper was that it established the mathematical fundations for a machine with "Universal application" i.e. The electronic computer .
