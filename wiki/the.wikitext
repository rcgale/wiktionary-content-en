'''the''' 

The word "'''the'''" functions primarily as the definite [[w:grammatical article|grammatical article]] in  the [[w:English language|English language]].  

''The''  can also mean "sufficient", as in "lacked the gumption to make his move".  It can also be used as a [[w:possessive pronoun|possessive pronoun]], as in "can't walk right since the ankle went"; as an expression of a [[w:ratio|ratio]], as in "five apples the dollar"; and as an [[w:adverb|adverb]].

In its adverbial use, it appears twice, each time before a [[w:comparative|comparative]] adjective or adverb to denote a commensurate relationship, as in "the more the merrier".

===Pronunciation===
*(''before consonant''): <i>th</i>ə, /ðə/, /D@/
*(''before vowel or stressed''): <i>th</i>ē, /ðiː/, /Di:/

It is generally pronounced with a long ''e'' before a word starting with a [[w:vowel|vowel]] and with a [[w:schwa|schwa]] before a word beginning with a [[w:consonant|consonant]]. However, for emphasis on the importance or veracity of its following word, ''the'' is pronounced with long ''e'' regardless as to whether the following word is consonant- or vowel-initial. In this use, ''the'' alone may be used to eliminate the [[w:adjective|adjective]] "pre-eminent", as in "''the'' hospital for back problems".  But in written expressions, such as "the novelist of middle-class despair," it can stand without emphasis since the context is clear.  

===Etymology===

The existence of a definite article is not shared by the common ancestor of the  [[w:Indo-European|Indo-European]] languages.  The older languages get along without them; there is no article in [[w:Latin|Latin]], [[w:Sanskrit|Sanskrit]], or in conservative Indo-European languages like [[w:Russian language|Russian]].  As in the [[w:etymology|etymologies]] of many other languages, the word originally entered the language as a demonstrative [[w:pronoun|pronoun]] or [[w:adjective|adjective]]; compare the fate of the Latin demonstrative ''ille'' in the [[w:Romance languages|Romance languages]], becoming [[French language|French]] ''le'', ''la'' and ''les'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''el'' and ''la'', and [[Italian language|Italian]] ''il'' and ''la''.  ''The'' and ''that'' are common developments from the same [[w:Old English|Old English]] system.  Old English had a definite article ''se'', in the masculine [[w:grammatical gender|gender]], ''seo'', feminine, and ''&thorn;&aelig;t'', neuter.  In [[w:Middle English|Middle English]] these had all fallen together into ''&thorn;e'', the ancestor of the [[w:Modern English|Modern English]] word.
