'''the''' 

# Definite [[w:grammatical article|grammatical article]].  Unlike many languages, English does not inflect its articles for gender, case or number.
#: ''The word "the" is the most common word in the English language.''
#: ''The men, the women, the boy and the girl watched the man give the birdseed to the birds.''
# When stressed, indicates that the object in question is considered to be the best or the only one worthy of attention.
#: ''That is ''the'' hospital to go to for heart surgery.''
# With an adjective, indicates all persons to whom the adjective applies.
#: ''Feed the hungry, clothe the naked, comfort the afflicted, and afflict the comfortable.''
# With a [[comparative]] or ''[[more]]'' and a verb phrase, establishes a parallel with one or more other such comparatives (often but not always a similar construction with ''the'').
#: ''The hotter the better.''
#: ''The more I think about it, the weaker it looks.''
#: ''It looks weaker and weaker, the more I think about it.''
#: ''The more money donated, the more books purchased and the more happy children.''
# With a [[superlative]], indicates the person or thing to which the superlative applies.
#: ''That apple pie was the best.''

<!--''The''  can also mean "sufficient", as in "lacked the gumption to make his move".-->
<!-- No, this is OK without ''the'', though this usage is less common -->
<!-- It can also be used as a [[w:possessive pronoun|possessive pronoun]], as in "can't walk right since the ankle went";-->
<!-- I doubt this is quite what's going on: "So, you can't walk right since the ankle went?"  This usage is very close to ''that''-->
<!-- as an expression of a [[w:ratio|ratio]], as in "five apples the dollar"; -->
<!-- First, this sounds odd to me, or at least dated.  Second, ''a/and'' serves in similar situations, notably ''five miles an hour''.  I would say that ''the dollar'' here is idiomatic, not rule-based, but I could be wrong. -->

===Pronunciation===
*(''stressed'') <i>th</i>ē, /ðiː/, /Di:/
*(''unstressed'') <i>th</i>ə, /ðə/, /D@/ (''but see notes below'')

====Notes====
The word ''the'' is pronounced /ðiː/ whenever it is pronounced as a distinct word, e.g.:

* When it is used for emphasis (''This is ''the'' hospital for heart surgery.'').
* When the speaker pauses between ''the'' and the next word (''the ... sovereignity'').
* In many but not all dialects, when the next word begins with a vowel (''the onion'').
<!--no: this is not true: * When referred to as a word (''the word "the"''). -->

The word is generally not pronounced distinctly when attached to a word beginning with a consonant, in which case the ''e'' becomes a [[schwa]] or is dropped entirely.  In dialects that do not pronounce ''the'' distinctly before a vowel, a glottal stop is generally inserted (e.g., ''the Us'' in ''the Us festival'' would still be pronounced differently from ''thus'' in ''thus festival seating should be outlawed'').

===Etymology===

Old English ''&thorn;&aelig;t'', neuter article; Middle English ''&thorn;&aelig;t'', definite article.
