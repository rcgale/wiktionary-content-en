===Etymology===
Middle English '''[[mariage]]''', from Old French '''[[mariage]]''', from '''[[marier]]''' "to marry", from Latin '''[[maritare]]''' "to marry", literally "give a husband to", from '''[[maritus]]''' "married man, husband", derived probably from Proto-Indo-European ''*mari-'', perhaps a feminine stem of ''*mer-yo-'' "young man or young woman" (hence ''*mari-to-'' "given a wife"), if not somehow connected with '''[[mas]]''' "male" (stem ''mar-'').
