==English==

=== Noun ===
'''cake'''
#a rich, sweet dessert [[food]], typically made of flour, sugar, eggs, and baked in an [[oven]]. A [[gâteau]] or sponge cake includes a chemical leavening agent (e.g. baking powder), making it light and airy. The denser [[torte]] omits the leavening agent, and uses less flour and more eggs.
#a [[block]] of solid material
#:''a cake of soap''
#(''slang'') a trivially easy task or responsibility; from "piece of cake"
