The term Contact Juggling was coined by James Ernest in a book of the same name.
Contact Juggling is the art of moving a single ball or mutiple balls.  There are countless numbers of ways to move a ball.  Rolling and spinning are two ways most Contact Jugglers move the balls around.  Done seperately or together rolling and spinning can provide for countless variations.  The defining characteristic of Contact Juggling is that the artist stay in Contact with the ball or balls.  If the artist can do their movements blind then they are truely staying in Contact with the ball or balls.<BR>
