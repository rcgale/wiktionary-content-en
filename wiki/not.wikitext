===Usage Note===

In modern usage, the forms ''do not ...'' (or ''don't ...'') is preferred to '' ... not'' for all but a short list of verbs:

* ''They do not sow.'' (modern) vs. ''They sow not.'' (KJB)

American usage tends to prefer ''don't have'' or ''haven't got'' to ''have not'' or ''haven't'', except when ''have'' is used as an auxilliary (or in the idiom ''have-not''):

* ''I don't have a clue.'' or ''I haven't got a clue'' (US) 
* ''I haven't a clue.'' (outside US)
* ''I haven't been to Spain.'' (universal)
