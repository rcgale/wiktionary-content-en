In modern usage, the forms ''do not ...'' (or ''don't ...'') is preferred to '' ... not'' for all but a short list of verbs (is/am/are/were, have/has/had, do/does/did, can/could, shall/should, will/would may/might, need): <!-- Did I miss any? --dmh -->

* ''They do not sow.'' (modern) vs. ''They sow not.'' (KJB)

American usage tends to prefer ''don't have'' or ''haven't got'' to ''have not'' or ''haven't'', except when ''have'' is used as an auxilliary (or in the idiom ''have-not''): <!-- Non-US please check -->

* ''I don't have a clue.'' or ''I haven't got a clue'' (US) 
* ''I haven't a clue.'' (outside US)
* ''I haven't been to Spain.'' (universal)

The verb ''need'' is only directly negated when used as an auxilliary, and even this usage is rare in the US.<!-- Non-US please check -->

* ''You don't need to trouble yourself'' (US)
* ''You needn't trouble yourself.'' (outside US)
* ''I don't need any eggs today.'' (universal)
