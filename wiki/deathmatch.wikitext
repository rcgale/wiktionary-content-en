* [[IPA]] /'dεðmætč/

===Etymology===
Presumably first used in id® Software's Doom®, which used the word to present an available style of networked game play. Networked games were very uncommon (if existant at all) before Doom®, which brought first person shooters into the limelight in becoming a vastly popular game.

===Noun===
# A one round computer game match, on a first person shooter, in which players are to play against one another, and possibly characters controlled by the computer, which have the same choices and circumstance as one another, making the game much like a sport. Points are usually scored by "fragging" another player, which is completely depleting the player's health so that he/she/it must start again at a (usually) random point on the map.

===Verb===
# Play a deathmatch.
