===Pronunciation===
* [[IPA]] /'dεðmætʃ/

===Etymology===
Presumably first used in [[w:id Software|id Software's]] ''Doom'', which used the word to present an available style of networked game play; networked games were uncommon before ''Doom''. Combination of modern english [[death]] + [[match]].

===Noun===
# Game mode found in [[first-person shooter]]s. Uses an equal playing ground, in that all players have the same abilities, items, and attributes, or can choose from the same sets of such traits, it would be usually considered that the aim of a deathmatch is to gain the highest number of [[frag]]s, but as with variants such as ''team deathmatch'', or certain modifications in which the counters decrement, this may vary slightly. The aim of a deathmatch is to hit other players with given weapons. Games that are team-oriented to the extent that a goal such as a flag or base bears more weight than [[frag]]s are not generally considered deathmatch games.

===Transitive Verb===
# Play a deathmatch against [someone].

===Adjective===
# Complying to the attributes of the deathmatch.
#:''Quake III is a deathmatch game.''
