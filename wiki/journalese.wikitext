'''Journalese''' is the artificial or [[hyperbole|hyperbolic]] language regarded as characteristic of the popular media. [[Joe Grimm]] of the [[Detroit Free Press]] likened journalese to a "stage voice": 

:We write journalese out of habit, sometimes from misguided training, and to sound urgent, authoritative and, well, journalistic. But it doesn't do any of that.

==Examples of Journalese==

:"The governor Thursday ..."
:"The Nov. 22, 1963, assassination of John F. Kennedy .."
:"Mean streets and densely wooded areas populated by ever-present lone gunmen ..."
:"Negotiators yesterday, in an eleventh-hour decision following marathon talks, hammered out agreement on a key wage provision they earlier had rejected."
