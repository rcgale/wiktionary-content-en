The phrase "'''''the greatest thing since sliced bread'''''" (or '''''greatest invention since sliced bread''''') is a [[hyperbolic]] (and sometimes [[sarcastic]]) means of praising an [[invention]] or other society-advancing development. Pre-sliced, packaged bread has existed only since [[1928]], but it appears to be something of an arbitrary selection as the benchmark against which later inventions should be judged.
