The phrase "'''''the greatest thing since sliced bread'''''" ("'''''best'''''" may be substituted for "'''''greatest'''''", and "'''''invention'''''" may be substituted for "'''''thing'''''") is a commonly used [[hyperbolic]] (and sometimes [[sarcastic]]) means of praising an [[invention]] or other society-advancing development. [[Sliced bread]] - meaning pre-sliced, packaged bread - has existed only since [[1928]], but it nevertheless appears to be something of an arbitrary selection as the benchmark against which later inventions should be judged.
