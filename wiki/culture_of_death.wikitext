'''''Culture of Death''''' is a [[rhetorical device]] used in contemporary political discourse in the [[United States]].  Popularized first by [[Pope John Paul II]] in his [[encyclical]] [[Evangelium Vitae]] and later by the [[Republican Party]] of the [[United States]].  It is often constrasted with a [[Culture of Life]] and is typically used in a derogatory manner to draw a parallel with the [[T-4 Euthanasia Program|euthanasia programs]] of [[Nazi Germany]].  

Advocates of the "Culture of Life" argue that a "Culture of Death" results in political, economic, or eugenic murder. They point to historical events such as the [[Holocaust]] or the [[Great Purge]]s in the [[Soviet Union]] as examples of devaluation of human life taken to its conclusion.  In the United States, the term often refers to support for legalized [[abortion]] or [[euthanasia]].

''Culture of Death'' was also used in [[Imperialism|Colonial Europe]] to describe [[barbarian|"barbaric"]] cultures which allegedly glorified or worshiped death.  This was then used as a justification for the subjagation and colonization of these cultures.
