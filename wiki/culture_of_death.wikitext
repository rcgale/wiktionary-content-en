'''''Culture of Death''''' is a [[rhetorical device]] used in contemporary political discourse in the [[United States]]. It is often constrasted with a [[Culture of Life]] and is typically used in a derogatory manner to draw a parallel with the [[T-4 Euthanasia Program|euthanasia programs]] of [[Nazi Germany]].  

Those that advocate a ''Culture of Life'' argue that a society with a ''Culture of Death'' is one in which individual human lives are not highly valued, and can be thought of as a means to an end. In such a society, individuals might be destroyed for political, economic, eugenic or obscurantist reasons. Thus, historical events such as the [[Holocaust]] or the [[Great Purge]]s in the [[Soviet Union]] may be the result of societies embodying a ''Culture of Death''.  In the United States, the term is often used in relation to the existence of legalized [[abortion]]. 

''Culture of Death'' was been used during debates regarding the maintenance or removal of feeding tubes for a medical patient named [[Terri Schiavo]] in the United States. So used, the term may imply that those who did not support the reinsertion of her feeding tube are part of a ''Culture of Death''.

''Culture of Death'' may also refer to cultures which glorified or worshipped death.
