'''''Culture of Death''''' is a [[rhetorical device]] used in contemporary political discourse in the [[United States]]. It is often constrasted with a [[Culture of Life]] and is typically used in a derogatory manner to draw a parallel with the [[T-4 Euthanasia Program|euthanasia programs]] of [[Nazi Germany]].  

Advocates of the "culture of life" argue that a "Culture of Death" results in political, economic, or eugenic murder. They point to historical events such as the [[Holocaust]] or the [[Great Purge]]s in the [[Soviet Union]] as examples of devaluation of human life taken to its conclusion.  In the United States, the term often refers to support for legalized [[abortion]] or [[euthanasia]].

''Culture of Death'' may also refer to cultures which allegecly glorify or worship death.
