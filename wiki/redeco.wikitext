A redeco is a re-released version of an existing [[toy]] with a color scheme that is significantly different from the original release.  Redecos normally include changes to the toy's paint application scheme, as opposed to a more straightforward [[repaint]], which only alters the colors, not the ways in which they are applied to the toy.  Redecos are an extremely popular way to create [[exclusive]] toys, allowing the new toy to look drastically different from the original without having to pay for an entirely new mold.
