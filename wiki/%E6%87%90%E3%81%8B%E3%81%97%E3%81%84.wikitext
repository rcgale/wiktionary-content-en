=== Adjective ===
'''懐かしい''' ([[なつかしい]], natsukashī)

# [[Dear]]; [[beloved]]; [[cherished]]; [[sweet]].
# [[Missed]]; [[long for|longed for]]; [[yearn]]ed after.


=== Usage note ===
It should be mentioned that the second meaning of '''懐かしい''' is much equivalent to a verb in English, even though it functions grammatically as an adjective.  In this regard it is quite similar to the adjectival noun [[好き]] (''liked'').  In Japanese, to express a yearning for something, or a slightly nostalgic feeling of missing something, you modify the object that is missed (e.g., home, one's old neighborhood, one's friend, one's cat) with '''懐かしい'''.  In this regard, Japanese is quite unlike English.
