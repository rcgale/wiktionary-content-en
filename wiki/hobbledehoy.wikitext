'''Hobbledehoy''' is an old [[Scots]] word for an awkward rustic adolescent boy or [[teenager]]. A hobbledehoy is na√Øve, gawky, and shy around women. He is neither a boy nor a man, and so is also called a halflin. The root word ''hob'' is also used to describe the little men of fairy tales, like hobs, [[hobgoblin]]s, and hobyahs. 

''The [[Hobbit]]'' (in a book by Tolkien) is a 3 foot tall man, half the height of a 6 foot man, and therefore a halfling. In [[Disney]]'s ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'', Ichabod Crane, a tall gawky school master, is described as a hobbledehoy in a song, referring to his awkwardness.
