=== Pronunciation ===
*[[w:SAMPA|SAMPA]]: /'{mp@(r)s{nd/
*[[w:IPA|IPA]]: /ˈæmpə(r)sænd/

==Etymology==
A corruption of ‘and per se--and' which is how the symbol was originally referred to in English.
The character itself is a stylized E and T or ''et'' the Latin word for and. Romans used such symbols at least since the first century AD, but the character may not have aquired its present form until the advent of calligraphy in the middle ages.

[[image:Et_Ampersand.jpg|frame|left|The "roman" ampersand on the left is stylised, but the "italic" one on the right is clearly similar to 'et'.]]

=== Noun ===
1. The symbol "[[&]]" itself. 
*''example'' The ampersand character in many logics acts as a operator connecting two propositions.
2. A substitute for the word [[and]] in any context (though not generally used outside of signs and titles).
