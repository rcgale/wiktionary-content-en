'''epigenetic'''

A change to [[DNA]] other than a change to the [[nucleotide]] sequence itself, that affects the expression of [[gene]]s within the nucleotide sequence. These changes include [[covalent]] modification of a nucleotide, such as [[cytosine]] [[methylation]]. Other changes include modification of proteins tightly associated with DNA, such as methylation, [[acetylation]] or [[phosphorylation]] of histones. Histone modification can make the DNA either tightly condensed, and therefore inaccessible to proteins that might other wise drive gene expression, or loosely condensed and therefore accessible to proteins that can induce expression of genes in that region of the [[genome]].
