=== Etymology ===
'''Yiff''' was originally invented by LittleFox as part of a range of [[onomatopoetic]] words that form the [[fox]]-ese language of the [[w:Furry|Furry]] rôle-playing community: '''yiff''', '''yip''', '''yerf''', '''yaff''', '''yarf''', '''growf''', and '''growlf''' (in order from most positive connotations to most negative connotations).  '''Yiff''' meant "[[yes]]" or an [[exuberant]] "[[hello]]!".  Later, '''yiff''' adopted the meaning of a [[sexual]] [[proposition]], a meaning that had previously been assigned to '''yipp''' (a coarse form of '''yip''').

Other claimed etymologies include:
* [[onomatopoetic]] word for the sound of a fox mating.  This etymology is unsubstantiated and appears to be [[apocryphal]].
* Sense 3 of [[YIFF]].  This is apparently a [[backronym]].

=== Usage note ===
The term is is not to be confused with the acronym [[YIFF]], although a [[backronym]] has been created for that (sense 3) in an attempt to explain the etymology of '''yiff'''.
