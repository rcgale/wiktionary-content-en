==Etymology==

*'''1990AD''' Alexander Scobie, ''Hitler's State Architecture'', page 114:

:"External symbols suggest that the domed hall was where Hitler as '''cosmocrator''' ([[German|Gr]] Herr der Welt) would appear before his Herrenvolk: On top of the dome's lantern was an eagle grasping in its claws not the usual swastika but the globe of the Earth ([[German|Gr]] Erdball)."

*'''1870AD''' E. Peacock, ''Ralf Skirl. III. 113'':
:"Endeavouring to solve that problem, which even the great '''cosmocrat''' we have alluded to seems to have found a difficult one."

*'''1831AD'''  Robert Southey, ''Devils Walk. 28'', 
:"You will not think great '''Cosmocrat'''!  That I spend my time in fooling."

*'''1831AD''' Robert Southey, ''Q. Rev. XLV. 427'':
:"The idiosyncratic demorcratic, '''cosmocratic''', comicocratic Jeremy that he [Bentham] is."

*'''1822AD''' T. Taylor, ''Apuleius 258'':
:"The '''cosmocrators''' [planets] are the leaders of the multitude in each."

*'''1708AD''' H. Dodwell, ''Nat. Mortality Hum. Souls 130'':
:"Yet they reckon her [Sophia] among their proper Aeons, far exceeding the Demiurgus and '''Cosmocratores'''."

*'''200AD''' Iranaeus (Bishop of Lyons) in the late second century, describes part of the complex mythology of ''Valentinus the Gnostic'':

:“They teach that the spirits of wickedness derive their origin from grief. Herein the devil, whom they also call '''Cosmocrator''' and the demons, and the angels, and every wicked spiritual being that exists found the source of their existence. They represent the Demiurge as being the son of that mother of theirs [Achamoth] and '''Cosmocrator''' as creature of the Demiurge. '''Cosmocrator''' has knowledge of what is above him, because he is a spirit of wickedness; but the Demiurge is ignorant of such things, inasmuch as he is merely animal.”
