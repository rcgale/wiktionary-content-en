*'''2003AD''' John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, ''A Future Perfect : The Challenge and Promise of Globalization'', 'Chapter 12 - Cosmocrats: An Anxious Elite' 

:page 69: "a cadre of people who live the global lifestyle more thoroughly than any other modern business people [...] well educated business school graduates." 

:page 226: "On the other hand, the definition of a '''cosmocrat''' is much tighter than just "somebody who had prospered from globalization."  '''Cosmocrats''' are defined by their attitudes and lifestyles rather than just their bank accounts.  That separates them from the widest class of winners from globalization, who are simply local people who have plugged into global networks [...] So who are the '''cosmocrats'''?  The backbone of the group is still provided by people such as Knapp: the loyal retainers of sprawling multinationals."

*'''1990AD''' Alexander Scobie, ''Hitler's State Architecture'', page 114:

:"External symbols suggest that the domed hall was where [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler Hitler] as '''cosmocrator''' ([[German|Gr]] Herr der Welt) would appear before his [[herrenvolk|Herrenvolk]]: On top of the dome's lantern was an eagle grasping in its claws not the usual swastika but the globe of the Earth ([[German|Gr]] Erdball)."

*'''200AD''' [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranaeus Iranaeus] in the late second century, describes part of the complex mythology of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentinius Valentinus] the Gnostic:

:“They teach that the spirits of wickedness derive their origin from grief. Herein the devil, whom they also call '''Cosmocrator''' and the demons, and the angels, and every wicked spiritual being that exists found the source of their existence. They represent the Demiurge as being the son of that mother of theirs [Achamoth] and '''Cosmocrator''' as creature of the Demiurge. '''Cosmocrator''' has knowledge of what is above him, because he is a spirit of wickedness; but the Demiurge is ignorant of such things, inasmuch as he is merely animal.”

:"And then a voice - of the '''Cosmocrator''' - came to the angels: "I am God and there is no other beside me.""
