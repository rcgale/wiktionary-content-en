===Etymology===
Possibly from the Old English, ''glowan'', though this is disputed because of the corresponding words in Old Saxon and Old High German are dissimilar, ''glojan'' and ''gluoen'' respectively. 
It may instead be from Old Norse word, ''glowa''. Its ultimate root is probably from Old Teutonic root word, ''glo''. See [[glass]].
