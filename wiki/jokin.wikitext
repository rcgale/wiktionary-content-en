==Finnish==

===Etymology===

Pronoun stem ''jo-'' + enclitic particle ''[[-kin]]''.

===Indefinite pronoun===
'''jokin''' (''stem'' '''jo-''', ''see below'')

# [[something]]
# (''adjectival'') [[one]], [[a]]

====Declension====
Case suffixes are regular. Only the first part is declined, the enclitic particle doesn't change its form. Some cases have parallel forms without the '''k''', see ''[[jotain]]'' for those.

====Usage notes====
This pronoun is used less often for people than ''[[joku]]'' is used for non-people.
