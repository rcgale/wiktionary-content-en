'''runoff'''
# That portion of precipitation or irrigation on an area which does not infiltrate, but instead is discharged from the area. That which is lost without entering the soil is called surface runoff. That which enters the soil before reaching a stream channel is called ground water runoff or seepage flow from ground water. (In [[soil science]] runoff usually refers to the water lost by surface flow; in [[geology]] and hydraulics runoff usually includes both surface and subsurface flow.)
