Originating in the movie [[Wayne's World]], an exclamation of happiness or appreciation for the female form:

"You've just won the lottery!"
"Schwing!"

Or,

"Schwing! I just beat the game!"

Or,

"[[Tia Carrere]] is such a hot babe. Schwing!"
 
Not to be confused with "schwingen," German for "to swing."

Also an [[Irish Gaelic]] colloquialism of appreciation for the male form; it is surprisingly inappropriate to use it about the female form.
