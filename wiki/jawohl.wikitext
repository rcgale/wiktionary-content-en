Jawohl is the word Ja, meaning 'yes' mixed with the emphatic wohl.  So Jawohl is an emphatic 'yes.'  It's used especially in a military context as, 'yes sir.'  For this reason Americans may only know it from WWII films, with rows of German soldiers saying, 'Jawohl.'  It's pronouced Ya-vole, or in some dialects (such as Bavarian) Ya-ole.
