The term is also used to describe the similarities between different models of an [[Airliner]] family. For example, the commonality between the [[Boeing 757]] and [[Boeing 767]] aircraft allowed the hijackers participating in the [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack]] to operate both the 757 and 767 with experience of only a single cockpit type.
