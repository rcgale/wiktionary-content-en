'''filk'''

==Etymology==
Originally "filk music" was a typo for "[[folk music]]" in a never-published essay on the influence of Science Fiction and Fantasy on folk music. Its first known deliberate use was by Karen Kruse Anderson in ''Die [[Zeitschrift]] f√ºr [[Vollstandig]]en [[Unsinn]]'' (''The [[Journal]] for [[Utter]] [[Nonsense]]'') #774 (June 1953), for a song written by the well known science fiction author Poul Anderson.  By the 1970s in Minneapolis, it was described as a blended word, coined from //folk// music and //filched// tunes, as most filk-tunes are parodies to well known tunes. 

# A form of [[music]] about or inspired by [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], horror, science, and/or subjects of interest to fans of [[speculative]] fiction; frequently, a [[song]] whose [[lyric]]s have been altered to refer to science fiction; a parody.
# To [[photoshop]]; to edit a photograph (commonly using the computer program PhotoShop) to comical effect.
