====Usage notes====

While ''shame'' is not generally counted, it is countable, for example
: ''I felt two shames: one for hurting my friend, and a greater one for lying about it.''
While shame has a strong social element and can carry fear of being shut out of society, it is also possible to feel private shame at violating ones own private standards.

===Verb===

#: ''I was shamed by the teacher's public disapproval.''
