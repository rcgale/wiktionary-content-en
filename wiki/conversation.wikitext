'''Conversation''': is the daily expression and exchange of individual opinions; a mechanism that refines [[communal understanding]] by promoting popular, while suppressing unpopular, notions. That is, all those ideas which match common feelings of right and wrong, will be repeated and magnified into reasons to act, while those which receive little or no support will inevitably be ignored; which makes conversation the ideas filter, or the mind, of the community.
