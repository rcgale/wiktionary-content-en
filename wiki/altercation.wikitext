===Quotations===
<blockquote>
&ldquo;What the hell is it to you who are my friends?&rdquo; roared McMurdo
in a voice which brought every head in the carriage round to
witness the altercation. &ldquo;Did I ask you for your advice, or did
you think me such a sucker that I couldn't move without it?  You
speak when you are spoken to, and by the Lord you'd have to wait
a long time if it was me!&rdquo;  He thrust out his face and grinned at
the patrolmen like a snarling dog.
<BR>&mdash;Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in ''The Valley of Fear''
