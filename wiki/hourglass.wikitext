'''hourglass'''
# Glass construction with two halves separated/connected with a narrow passage. There is sand in it which flows from one side to the other, obstructed by the narrow passage. The time to pass through is always the same, so it can serve to 'measure' time or at least make sure that a duration is twice the same.
