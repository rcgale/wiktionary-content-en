'''Adler''' ''n'', gen. Adlers, pl. Adler

====Etymology====
* Contraction of ''[[edel|edler]] [[Aar]]''. When ''Aar'' started assuming a more general meaning of "bird of prey suitable for hunting or falconry", the term ''edler Aar'' emerged to distinguish eagles from other hunting birds such as [[falcon]]s and [[hawk]]s.
