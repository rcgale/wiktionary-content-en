==Etymology==
Wikify was originally a [[w:Nonce word|nonce word]], a.k.a. a [[w:hapax legemenon|hapax legemenon]], but as the popularity of wikis grew, so did the usage of the word. Wikify comes from the root word [[w:wiki|wiki]], which comes from the Hawaiian term for "quick" or "super-fast".

While the first-ever wiki is cited as the [[w:Portland Pattern Repository|Portland Pattern Repository]], the actual wiki is intended as a supplement and is separate from the PPR. The ''original'' PPR is '''''certainly'' not a wiki''' in the current sense of the word. However, the WikiWikiWeb section is, and the origins of wiki can be traced here. The site's founder, [[w:Ward Cunningham|Ward Cunningham]], who chose the name wiki-wiki, claims that the format was partially inspired by the [[w:Apple Macintosh|Apple Macintosh's]] [[w:Hypercard|Hypercard]].
