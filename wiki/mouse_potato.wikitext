===Quotations===
* '''1994''' - Ruth Shurman - ''Me and my Gizmo: No. 8'' in ''The Guardian''(14 July 1994)
*:Lady Miss Kier is a mouse potato. 'I wake up, I go and turn the computer on before I wash my face or brush my teeth. I'll be sitting there in my underwear, and before I know it, four hours have passed. Then I pick up the phone, push some more buttons and the food delivery arrives, and then 16 hours have passed in front of the computer. It leaves you completely drained.'
* '''2001''' - Aniruddho Sanyal - ''The Trini Trinity Is Found On De Line'' in ''The Times Higher Education Supplement'' (7th December 2001) 
*:The internet, the authors say, affords the average mouse-potato the opportunity to experience a Naipaul-esque enigma of arrival in far-away lands without ever leaving the shores of Trinidad.
