An organism which obtains its nutrition through the oxidation of non-organic compounds; this as opposed to the process of photosynthesis.

From the combination of the prefix "chemo" for chemical and "autotrophic" for "an organism capable of synthesizing its own food."

This term is most commonly used in reference to bacteria and other micro-organisms.
