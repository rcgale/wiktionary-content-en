enlightened is a quest for trhuth.It is more of a permanent phase rather than an act.We have had various religous figures that have explored the possibilty of feeling the presence of  god.Its a form of extreme mental as well as spiritual purity.
Gautama buddha felt the compassion that rose from  the sight of people suffering.He grieved for them and decided to renounce his title and the world of luxury.
He wanted to search for the eternal truth .Instead of seeking that outside ,he ventured inside his mind.
