'''Link doping''' refers to the practice and effects of embedding a large number of gratuitous [[hyperlink]]s on a website in exchange for return [[link]]s. Mainly used when describing [[weblog]]s (or [[blog]]s), link doping usually implies that a person links to sites he or she has never visited in return for a place on the [[website]]'s link list for the sole purpose of inflating the apparent popularity of his or her website. Since the ranking [[algorithm]]s of many Internet directories and search engines rely on the number of links to a website to determine its importance or influence, link doping can result in a high placement or ranking for the offending website .

Originally used by Erik Grayson in an [http://www.sobriquetmagazine.com/2005/06/sobriquet-198-on-link-doping.html essay] published in [http://www.sobriquetmagazine.com Sobriquet Magazine] and on [http://blogcritics.org/archives/2005/06/19/011301.php Blogcritics.org], link doping has been confused with the related practice of excessive hyperlinking, also known as "link whoring". While the two phrases may be used interchangeably to describe gratuitous linking, link doping carries the additional connotation of deliberately striving to attain a certain level of success for one's website without having earned it through hard work (as an average athlete on steroids might perform better than a naturally gifted athlete not on performance-enhancing drugs).
