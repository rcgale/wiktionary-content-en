====Usage notes====
#The choice between ''-ward'' and ''-wards'' is individual or dialectal; both are widely used.
#Adverbs ending in -wards ([[AS.|Anglo-Saxon]] ''-weardes'') and some other adverbs, such as besides, betimes, since ({{OE.}} ''sithens''.) etc., were originally genitive forms used adverbially.
#The adjectives [[toward]] (initial stress) and [[froward]] have meanings not predictable from the meaning of ''-ward''.
#[[Awkward]] has retained the form but lost much of the sense in its use of this suffix.
