====Usage notes====

#Adverbs ending in -wards (Anglo-Saxon ''-weardes'') and some other adverbs, such as besides, betimes, since Old English ''sithens''.) etc., originated as genitive forms used adverbially.
#The adjectives [[toward]] (initial stress) and [[froward]] have meanings not predictable from the meaning of ''-ward''.
#[[Awkward]] has retained the form but lost much of the sense in its use of this suffix.
