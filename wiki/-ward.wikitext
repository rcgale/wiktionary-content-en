'''-ward''' ([[-wards]])
#Adverbs ending in -wards (AS. -weardes) and some other adverbs, such as besides, betimes, since ([[OE.]] ''sithens''.) etc., were originally genitive forms used adverbially.  Suffixes denoting course or direction to; motion or tendency toward; as in backward, or backwards; toward, or towards, etc. The choice between ''-ward'' and ''-wards'' is individual or dialectal; both are widely used.
