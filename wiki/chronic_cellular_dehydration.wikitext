'''Chronic cellular dehydration''' is a term varyingly used in [[medicine]] and [[marketing]] to describe a state in which an individual's [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s are [[chronic]]ally [[Dehydration|dehydrated]].  In the medical literature, the term is rarely used, and when it is used, different causes and symptoms are ascribed from its popular use in marketing, where it is often [[Sensationalism|sensationalized]] and used to sell various health food products and [[water ionizer]]s.

In the medical literature, ''chronic cellular dehydration'' is not used to describe a condition distinct from ''chronic dehydration'', but rather to point out the effects of chronic dehydration on an individual's cells.  Thus, at least as it is widely understood, an individual who does not suffer from chronic dehydration is in no danger of suffering from chronic cellular dehydration.

On the other hand, in marketing of various health food products, particularly beverages marketed as having rehydrating properties, and most pervasively (or depending on one's point of view, notoriously) water ionizers.  Different claims about the causes of chronic cellular dehydration are offered, depending on the marketing goals; it is clear, however, that the term is meant to refer to something distinct from chronic dehydration.  As an example, consider the claim made by marketers of water ionizers that ionized water is more readily absorbed by the body.  The crux of this claim is that even when an individual consumes sufficient water, the body may not absorb enough to combat chronic cellular dehydration.  These claims are usually coupled with blaming on chronic cellular dehydration a wide variety of health problems.
