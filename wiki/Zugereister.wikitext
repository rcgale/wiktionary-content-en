In countries where [[German language|German]] is spoken (basically [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]]), a '''''Zugereister''''' (literal translation from German: "someone who has travelled here [and stayed]") is someone who, for whatever reason (job, marriage, [[free will]]), has moved to a different region and settled there for good. They will have no or hardly any difficulty communicating with the locals but will forever be recognized by their [[accent (language)|accent]] and regarded by them as "not one of us". A man is ''ein Zugereister'', a woman ''eine Zugereiste''.

It should be noted, however, that this phenomenon mainly applies to rural areas, whereas people who move to the large cities are usually not stigmatized according to where they come from.

People whose [[first language]] is not German are '''not''' referred to as ''Zugereiste'' (even if the concept of travelling from A to B and settling down at B is the same).

The word exists in many regional variants, with different spellings and pronunciations.
