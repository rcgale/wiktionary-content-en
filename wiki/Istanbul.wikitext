=== Etymology ===
The name '''Istanbul''' was given to the city of [[Constantinople]] when it was conquered by the [[Ottoman]] [[Turks]] in 1453.<br>  
The word is a [[bastardization]] of the [[Greek]] phrase '''''eis tan polin''''' "into the city" which is how Constantinople was refered to by the local Greeks.  The Turkish ascribe the etymology of '''Istanbul''' to the phrase '''''Islam bol''''' "plenty of Islam" or possibly "city of Islam" as the Greek term for city "polis" has been adapted into Turkish as "-bolu"
