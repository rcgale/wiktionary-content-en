1.Having to do with the "fundamentals" of something, most commonly in reference to religion.
The Islamic Fundamentalists are in the news alot because they are terrorists, but their counterparts, the Christian   Fundamentalists,are not in the news yet because they have not yet met the challenge to escalate the action component of their belief systems'destiny, which of course, is to destroy evil, ie. the Islamic Fundamentalist Terrorists.
2.What is left after all dogma and " tradition" is stripped away from organized religion and  one gets back to the core basics of the origens of their religion, usually the Bible and or other documents. Christian Fundamentalists believe, for example, that only what is in the Holy Bible, is legitamate. Anything added to it or taken or explained away from what the bible teaches, is evil and is to be destroyed. Also, the Bible is to be read as literal. This means that it means what it says, word for word. Remember that the first rule of translation is to translate something word for word, ie. to take its meaning literally. Of course there are many areas and phrases that are clearly indicated as non-literal, ie. as symbolic or prophetic, allegorical,etc. In these cases an intelligent man can clearly see that a non-literal meaning is evident and intended and understands clearly and easily that such words or phrases are not to be taken literally.
