coulterism -n- Data that has been deliberately misrepresented or completely fabricated in order to support an otherwise unsupportable partisan position. Presumably from the name of Ann Coulter, outspoken conservative author and pundit.

Ann Coulter is seen by many as a 'radical conservative,' and as such has been accused of stretching data to achieve her point (as will 'radicals' of any leaning.)  This definition has definitely negative connotations, but be aware that it was likely coined in response to Coulter's opinions by a similarly radical liberal thinker.
