===Etymology===
From French '''-ible''', from Latin '''[[-ibilis]]'''

===Suffix===
'''-ible'''

An adjective suffix, now usually in a passive sense; forms adjectives meaning:
#able to be
#:mov'''able''': able to be moved
#:amend'''able''', able to be amended
#:blam'''able''', able to be blamed
#:sal'''able''', able to be sold
#relevant or suitable to, in accordance with
#:fashion'''able'''

====Note====
*The form '''[[-able]]''' is used in the same sense and is pronounced the same.

*In general, forms derived from Latin verbs of the second, third, and fourth conjugations take '''-ible''', as well as a few words whose roots end in a soft '''c''' or '''g'''.  All other words take '''-able''', particularly words from the Latin first conjugation, words that evolved through French, and words from Anglo-Saxon.
*Fowler, in his ''English Usage'', recommends using '''-ible''' for simplicity in spelling with '''any''' verb whose root ends in a soft '''c''' or '''g''' (such as '''changible''' vs. '''changeable'''), but this recommendation has generally not been followed.
