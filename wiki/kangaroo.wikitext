[,kæŋgə'ru:]
===Etymology===
From Guugu Yimidhirr (Aboriginal language) ''gangurru'' meaning ''a large grey or black kangaroo''. 

In a widely circulating myth Captain Cook is supposed to have asked a native "What is that?" to which the reply "kangaroo", meaning "I don't understand" was given. This story, although amusing, is completely untrue.

#'''Kangaroo Court''': a [[fraudulent]] or [[unjust]] trial where the decision has essentially been made in advance, usually for the purpose of providing a conviction.  Also [[show trial]].
