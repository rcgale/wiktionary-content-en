The small bits of fluff that bundle on a woolen jumper over time. This word has its origins in the 19th century English spoken in Donegal in north west of Ireland where the local people are reckoned to have the largest lexicon of both English and Gaelic in Ireland. Unused for over a century in the 1990s the word experienced a renaissance when it was seized upon by a group of middle class Dubliner's and used an icon of their rapidly fading heritage.
