'''Flitterjigs''' are the small bits of fluff that bundle on a [[wool]]en [[sweater|jumper]] over time. This word has its origins in the [[19th century]] English spoken in [[Donegal]] in north west of [[Ireland]] where the local people are reckoned to have the largest lexicon of both [[English language|English]] and [[Gaelic language|Gaelic]] in Ireland. Unused for over a century in the [[1990s]] the word experienced a renaissance when it was seized upon by a group of middle class [[Dublin]]ers and used an icon of their rapidly fading heritage.
