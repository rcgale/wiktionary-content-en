'''Flitterjigs''' are the small bits of fluff that bundle on a [[wool]]en [[sweater|jumper]] over time. This word has its origins in the [[19th century]] English spoken in county [[Donegal]] in north west of [[Ireland]] where the local people are reckoned to possess the largest lexicon of both [[English language|English]] and [[Gaelic language|Gaelic]] in Ireland. Unused for over a century, the word experienced a renaissance in the early [[1990s]] when it was seized upon by a group of middle class [[Dublin]]ers and a rogue Clareman and subsequently used as an endearing icon of their rapidly fading heritage.
