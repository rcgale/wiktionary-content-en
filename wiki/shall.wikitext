====Usage Note====
Historically '''will''' and '''shall''' have been used similarly, though in a fairly complicated manner dependent on the context. When used with '''I''' and '''we''' (first person) '''shall''' would have been a simple future, but '''will''' would have been treated with more strength, similar to the use of '''[[must]]''', so that ''I must not eat any more cake'' and ''I will not eat any more cake'' share the same strength, whereas '''shall''' would be more of a thought in passing. The opposite would be the case in the second and third persons ('''you''', '''they''' etc), where ''You shall take the dog for a walk tomorrow!'' would be something of an order, in contrast with ''You will take the dog for a walk tomorrow'', which simply states what is planned to happen. Recently, this distinction has been used less often, though it could be argued that it comes naturally from the sound of the words in certain methods of speech.
