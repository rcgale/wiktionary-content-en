====Usage Note====
Historically '''shall''' is the present tense and '''[[should]]''' is its past tense.
:''You have done that you '''should''' be sorry for.''
:''You have done that you '''shall''' be sorry for.''

In the past, '''will''' and '''shall''' have been used similarly as auxiliary verbs for the future tense. The simple future tense traditionally uses '''shall''' for the first person ("I" and "we"), and '''will''' for the second and third persons.
:I shall go.
:You will go.

An emphatic future tense, with a sense of '''must''', reverses the two words, using '''will''' for the first person and '''shall''' for the second and third person.
:I shall go.
:You will go.

The distinction seems to be dying out, and '''will''' is becoming common for all persons, along with other formations like "I am going to go" and "I am about to go."
