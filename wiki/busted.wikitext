<!-- Also used in present tense, as "I'm going to bust that drug dealer," but the past participle
is taking on a life of its own.  In particular, it can combine with "so", as in "you're so busted", but then again, I've also heard "you're so fired".  This is probably really a special usage of so, treating any past participle as an adjective for special flavor -->
