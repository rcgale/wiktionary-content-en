The stem, or whole dollar price, of a quote, often used in reference to foreign currencies or money markets. 
  
For example, if a foreign currency was trading at 108.3457 and a money market security was trading at 108.6666, both would have big figures of 108. Traders will often not mention the '''big figure''' when quoting a security, assuming that other traders know this number.
