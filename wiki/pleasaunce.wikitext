===Quotes===
#''And he looked in the mirror, and, seeing his own face, he gave a great cry and woke, and the bright sunlight was streaming into the room, and from the trees of the garden and '''pleasaunce''' the birds were singing.'' -- [[w:Oscar Wilde]], "House of Pommegranates" (1915 Methuen and Co. edition)
#''This would take the heart out of anything which was trying to flower there, and it is only natural that, with the exception of the three groundsel beds, the garden is now a wilderness. Perhaps “wilderness” gives you a misleading impression of space, the actual size of the '''pleasaunce''' being about two hollyhocks by one, but it is the correct word to describe the air of neglect which hangs over the place.'' -- [[w:A A Milne]], "If I May" (from an essay called "A London Garden")
#''King Amor planted the seed in a '''pleasaunce''' of its own. It grew into the most beautiful blue flower the world had ever known.'' -- [[w:Frances Hodgson Burnett]], "The Land of the Blue Flower"
