== '''External Risks''' ==


[[Risks]] that are produced by a non-human source and are beyond human control. They are unexpected but happen regularly enough in a whole population to be broadly predictable. Good examples of external risks are [[natural disasters]] such as [[earthquakes]] and [[volcanoes]].
