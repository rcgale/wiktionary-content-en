'''honcho dori''' just fine, in good shape or good condition

The origin of ''honcho dori'' is uncertain. Some dictionaries cite what may well be its authentic origin: Japan. 

In July, 1853, American Commodore Matthew C. Perry steamed into Japanese waters in his black sailing vessels, ending 250 years of isolation of Japan from the West. 

Perry's sailors, venturing into Japanese port cities in search of entertainment, when returning to the ship often found themselves lost in a maze of narrow streets and alleys. However once they found the "main street" in the city, it most often led to the dock and their ship. 

Most port cities had such a street and it was named "honcho dori" -- thus, once one found honcho dori, everything would be just fine, and getting back to the ship not a problem. Hunky dory may well be an Americanized pronunciation of honcho dori.
