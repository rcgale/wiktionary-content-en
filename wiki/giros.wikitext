===Pronunciation===
The pronunciation of gyros/giros/[[γύρος]] varies widely, even having dialect variation in Greece.

The pronunciation [[WEAE]] /ˈji.ɹoz/ is promoted on advertising posters in many restaurants; /ˈji.ɹos/ (the ''s'' is voiceless) is probably the most authentic (that is, sounds most like the Greek but uses only American English sounds).  The completely Anglicized pronunciation is /ˈʤaɪ.ɹoz/.

The form [[gyro]] is based on [[metanalysis]]:  ''gyros'' looks plural in English, and is often thus pronounced, so a singular ''gyro'' was formed.
