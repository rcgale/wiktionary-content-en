====Quotations====
'''1996''' One of the great projects in the history of modern thought has been the attempt to achieve the untainted perspective, the Archimedean view of reality &mdash; "the view from nowhere," as the philosopher Thomas Nagel calls it. The main theme of this book is that neither physics nor philosophy has yet paid enough attention to the temporal aspect of this ancient quest. In particular, I want to show that if we want to understand the asymmetry of time then we need to be able to understand, and quarantine, the various ways in which our patterns of thought reflect the peculiarities of our own temporal perspective. We need to acquaint ourselves with what might aptly be called the view from '''''nowhen'''''. &mdash; ''Time's Arrow and Archimedes' Point'', Huw Price, Oxford University Press
