==[[Adverb]]==
#A word used to show agreement or acceptance. 
#:'' "Yes, you are correct." '' 
#:'' "Yes, you may go to the bathroom now."'' 
#In English, ''yes'' can also be used to indicate ''disagreement'' or ''dissent'' if the original statement was negative.  For example, "You don't want it, do you?" and "Don't you want it?" are answered by "yes" if the respondent ''does'' want the item, and ''no'' if he or she does not.  Many languages use a different word for this purpose.
