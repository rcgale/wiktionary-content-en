The ''significant other'' is the person who is very important to another person of the other sex. It is almost exclusively used in terms of two people in a romantic or sexual relationship.  It is often used as a non-gender-specific reference to replace [[boyfriend]] or [[girlfriend]].  It basically represents something less than a spouse but more than a casual friend.
