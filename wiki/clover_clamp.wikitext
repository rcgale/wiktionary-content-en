'''Clover clamps''' are one of a number of clamping or pinching devices primarily marketed as marital aids.  Clover clamps usually come in pairs connected by a length of chain; they differ from similar devices by a system of levers attached to the chains that, when the chains are pulled, increase the gripping force of the clamps.
