#The material famous physicist Albert Einstein proposed existed. Lambda was supposed to be a substance that filled the universe. The preposition turned out to be wrong, because in order to be right, lambda held a constant density, no matter what the volume it was filling. That violates many laws of physics, so lambda couldn't exist. (it was later found that Einstein had fudged his numbers to come up with lambda.)
