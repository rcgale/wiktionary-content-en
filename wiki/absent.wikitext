'''Absent''', ''<code>[[adjective (part of speech)|adjective]]</code>'' [F., fr. ''absens'', ''absentis'', p. pr. of ''abesse'' to be away from; ''ab'' + ''esse'' to be. Cf. [[Sooth]].]

<ol>
<li>Being away from a place; [[withdrawn]] from a place; not present.

'''Synonyms:''' -- [[Absent]], [[Abstracted]]. These words both [[imply]] a want of attention to surrounding objects. We speak of a man as ''absent'' when his thoughts wander [[unconsciously]] from present [[scenes]] or [[topics]] of discourse; we speak of him as ''abstracted'' when his mind (usually for a brief period) is drawn off from present things by some [[weighty]] matter for reflection. ''Absence'' of mind is usually the result of loose habits of thought; ''abstraction'' commonly [[arises]] either from [[engrossing]] interests and cares, or from [[unfortunate]] habits of association.
