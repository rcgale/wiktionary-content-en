The '''bellyflop''' is an undesired way of entering the water in [[diving]] (not scuba). In it, the body enters the water horizontally or nearly so, belly down. For many people, this can be rather painful. If entering water from a height, it is best to do so feet first unless trained in platform or springboard diving, or competitive swimming.

Sometimes something is said to '''bellyflop''', meaning that it failed.
