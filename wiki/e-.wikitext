====Prefix====
'''e-''' (most often written with the hyphen)
#in an electronic form, usually in association with the internet
====Usage notes====
This practice began with ''[[e-mail]]'' perhaps as far back as 1971.  Mnny terms beginning with ''e-'' can be seen in both hyphenated (e.g. ''e-card'') and unhyphenated (e.g., ''ecard'') form, and sometimes&mdash;particularly in a business context&mdash;the letter following the ''e-'' will be capitalized (e.g., ''eBusiness'' or ''e-Business'').  In the present day, ''e-'' is generally used to indicate association with or transmission over the Internet.    In proper names beginning with ''e-'', the convention is generally to leave the ''e-'' lowercase, and to capitalize the second letter of the name (e.g., ''eBay'').  This can even be done at the beginning of a sentence.
