'''kite''' (''plural'' '''kites''')

#A [[bird of prey]] with long wings and weak legs that mostly feeds on [[carrion]] and spends long periods [[soar]]ing.

Traditionally constructed from a frame covered by [[fabric]] or [[paper]], but may be from any lightweight material or construction method, for example the [[parafoil]]. Smaller examples are used as children's toys, larger kites are used for sport or even for military applications.
<!-- this def is too narrow really...A child's toy consisting of thin, flexible material such as [[fabric]] or [[paper]] fixed over a frame and attached to a long string, often in the form of a geometrical kite (see the geometrical definition), which is sent up into the air, kept [[aloft]] by the wind and controlled by pulling on the string. -->
