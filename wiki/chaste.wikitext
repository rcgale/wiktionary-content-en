===Pronunciation===
*chāst, /tʃeɪst/, /tSeIst/
*:'''Homophones''': [[chased]]
*:[[Rhymes:English:-eɪst|Rhymes: -eɪst]]

===Etymology===
From Latin ''[[castus]]'', '''pure'''

===Adjective===
'''chaste'''

# morally [[pure]]
# (''sometimes considered incorrect'') abstaining from sexual intercourse

:Note: '''chaste''' is often confused with ''[[abstinence]]''.  Strictly speaking, ''chaste'' means '''pure''' and not "abstaining from sex", because married couples are often exhorted to have "chaste sex"--cf. the Vatican encyclical ''Casti Connubii'' ('''Of Chaste Wedlock''').
