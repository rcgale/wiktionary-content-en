===Etymology===
Named after the astronomer [[w:Gerard_Kuiper|Gerard Kuiper]] (1905-1973); and ''belt'' to be similar to "[[asteroid belt]]".

===Pronunciation===
IPA: [[WEAE]] /ˈkaɪ.pɚ.bɛlt/

Pronunciation notes: ''Kuiper'' is a Dutch surname, so it could be pronounced authentically in the Dutch manner (...someone who knows Dutch specify, please...).  However, Gerard Kuiper himself used an American pronunciation.

===Noun===
A region of [[space]] between 30 and 50 [[AU]] from the sun, roughly confined within a thick band around the [[ecliptic]].  This area is populated by many thousands of [[trans-Neptunians]], of which [[Pluto]] is the largest known.
