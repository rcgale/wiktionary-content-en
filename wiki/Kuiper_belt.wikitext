==English==
===Etymology===
Named after the astronomer [[w:Gerard_Kuiper|Gerard Kuiper]] (1905-1973); and ''belt'' to be similar to [[Astroid Belt]].

===Pronunciation===
IPA: [[WEAE]] /ˈkaɪ.pɚ.bɛlt/

Pronunciation notes: ''Kuiper'' is a Dutch surname, so it could be pronunced "authentically" in the Dutch manner (...someone who knows Dutch specify, please...).  However, Gerard Kuiper himself used an American pronunciation.

===Noun===
A region of space between 30 and 50 AU from the sun, roughly confined within a thick band around the ecliptic.  This area is populated by many thousands of ''trans-Neptunians'', of which Pluto is the largest known.
