==Etymology==

Via Old French "calendier" from Latin "[[calendarium]]" (''account book''). The Latin word is named after [[calendae]], the first [[day]] of the [[month]], at which the interest was paid, which in turn derives from [[calare]] (''to announce solemnly, to call out''), from an Indo-European base *[[kel-]].

The spelling with 'a' in English is to distinguish the word from [[calender]].
