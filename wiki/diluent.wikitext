'''diluent'''

#'''Diluent''' is a term describing a [[diluting]] agent. Certain fluids are too [[viscous]] to be pumped easily or too dense to flow from one particular point to the other.  This can be a problem because it might not be economically feasible to transport such 'heavy' fluids.

To ease the restricted movement of such fluids, diluents (or thinners or dilutants) are used - which act so as to decrease the viscosity of these fluids, whereby also decreasing the pumping/transportation costs.
For example, nail polish thinner is used to improve the consistency of nail polishes making it more easily applicable.
