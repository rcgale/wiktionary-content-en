The transplantation of the organs (usually modified) of one species into another species. A common example is the use of a pig's heart as a temporary resort to a failing human heart. This medical procedure is not very common in the present, though different approaches are being taken in order to experiment with the possibilities of this medicine. Xenotransplantation dates back to the days of Ancient Greece, when (proven by distinctive evidence) humans were combined with animals, i.e. Centaurs: half men and half horse creatures.
