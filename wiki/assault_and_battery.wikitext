'''Assault and battery''' is the combination of two [[violence|violent]] [[crime]]s: [[assault]] (the [[threat]] of violence) and [[battery (crime)|battery]] (actual physical violence).  This [[law|legal]] distinction only exists in [[jurisdiction]]s that distinguish assault as ''threatened'' violence rather than ''actual'' violence.
