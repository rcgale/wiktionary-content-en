A '''Guard ship''' is a warship stationed at some port or harbour to act as a guard, and in former times in the [[British navy]] to receive the men impressed for service. She usually was the flagship of the admiral commanding on the coast.

A guard-boat is a boat which goes the round of a fleet at anchor to see that due watch is kept at night.
