'''black hole'''

#The most dense material in the universe, usually formed by a collapsing massive [[star]].  It is so dense that the matter is condensed into a single point, known as a [[singularity]], and the [[gravity]] is so intense that not even [[light]] can escape it if it has entered the [[event horizon]].  As a result of the intense gravity, space and time itself are warped around the event horizon and time is slowed to almost nothing for anything entering the event horizon.
