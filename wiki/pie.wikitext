===[[Noun]]===

A kind of [[cake]]

===[[Verb]]===

A tactical maneuver used by police SWAT teams, "pie a corner".  It's some kind of technique for looking around a corner of a building when you think there might be an attacker on the other side.  Can someone give a more precise definition?  I'd hoped to find one here.
