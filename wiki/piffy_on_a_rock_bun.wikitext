A slang phrase common in North-West [[England]], often heard on [[Coronation Street]] (sometimes shortened to just '''"Like Piffy"''').

To be left '''"Like Piffy On a [[Rock Bun]]"''' means to be ignored or sidelined from an activity, the Northern equivalent of the Southern, "Like a lemon". An example of it's use might be, "I hate your works parties; you always talk shop with your mates and leave me sat like Piffy on a rock bun".

Age and eymology are uncertain, although it certainly existed in the [[1930s]] and possibly derives from a [[music hall]] catchphrase. Some commentators (e.g. [http://www.worldwidewords.org World Wide Words]) suggest that Piffy may have originally been Patience, and the Rock Bun was simply a Rock (i.e. a [[statue]]).
