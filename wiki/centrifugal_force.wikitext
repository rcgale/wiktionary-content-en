The force generated as an object spins or rotates.  This force travels outward from the center of rotation.  This force is helpful in improving the accuracy of arrow and bullets shot from [[rifled]] gun barrels. It's also used to keep missiles on target. 

Centrifugal force [[counteract]]s the force of gravity in a planet or moon's rotation; the orbit's centrifugal force keeps the [[orbit]]al body from crashing into the planet it's orbiting, while [[gravity]] keeps the orbital body from flying off into space, for example.  Then of course, the spinning of the planet on its axis while moving through its orbit, keeps the orbit more or less [symmetrical].
