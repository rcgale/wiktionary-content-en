'''treehouse'''  (or ''tree house'')
#a [[house]], or [[similar]] [[structure]] within a [[tree]], or several trees, [[built]] with [[light]] [[material]]s and at least 3m off the [[ground]]; [[wood]], [[bamboo]] or [[aluminum]] are preferred [[construction]] materials.

Treehouses are a very eco-friendly way to live in a forest and thereby a favourite choice for researchers and forest guardians who need to live in the forest.

Different native american tribes used to live, or still live in treehouses like the Korowai in Papua New Guinea.

Today one can purchase a professional treehouse. There are about 20 companies who have specialized on this subject.
