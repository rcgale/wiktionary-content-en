An specialized type of nuclear weapon which produces relatively little heat or blast effects, but produces a significant quantity of neutrons which can kill humans and animals over a fairly large area: considered to be a weapon useful for attack, since it leaves real estate and other property intact.  The Soviet Union was reputed to have stockpiled a large number of neutron bombs for use in a war in Central Europe, to destroy NATO forces while leaving terrain relatively undamaged.
