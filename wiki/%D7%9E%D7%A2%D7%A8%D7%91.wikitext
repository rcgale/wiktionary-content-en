'''Maarav''' ([[Standard Hebrew]] '''&#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;''') is a word in [[Hebrew language]] that means "[[West]]". 

In [[Biblical Hebrew]] the name of the western direction was '''Yama''' because that the [[Mediterranean Sea]] was in the west of [[Israel]]. Its [[etymology]] is derived from the word "Erev" - which means "[[evening]]", since the sun sets in the west, and thus starting the evening.

"The West" &#1492;&#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; is used by is [[Hebrew]] speaking people in [[Israel]] to call the block of countries who forged [[NATO]] and resisted the [[Soviet Union]]. Today it relates to the block of progress democratic states and includes: [[USA]], [[UK]], the [[European Union]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and friendly eastern European countries such as [[Poland]].
