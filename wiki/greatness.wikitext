'''Greatness''' is a vague concept that is heavily dependent on a person's perspective and biases.  It is a term that is often used, however, by people trying to emphasize a thing's superiority.  In [[Europe]] the most lauded rulers were given the attribute "the Great" (e.g. [[Alfred the Great]]). 

One common practice is to assemble lists of great people, things, and places.  They can be formulated by panels of experts, polls, or an ordinary individual.  While these lists can never be considered definitive this is part of their appeal for they inevitably spark debate over what should be listed.  

An especially common assembly of great things are [[greatest hits]] collections of tracks that are often released by music groups.
