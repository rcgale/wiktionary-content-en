'''Greatnesss''' is a vague concept that is heavily dependent on a person's perspective and biases.  It is a term that is often used however by people trying to emphasize a thing's superiority.  In [[Europe]] the most lauded rulers were given the suffix "the Great" (e.g. [[Alfred the Great]]). 

One common practice is to assemble lists of great people, things, and places.  They can be formulated by panels of experts, polls, or an ordinary individual.  While these lists can never considered definitive this is part of their appeal for the inevitably spark debate over what should be listed.  

An especially common assembly of great things are [[greatest hits]] collections of tracks that are often released by music groups.
