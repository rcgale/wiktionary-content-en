===Alternative spelling===
*'''[[arserun]]''' ('''arserunning''', '''arseran''', '''arserun''') (''UK'')

===Etymology===
First usage among gaming communities in the late 1990s; probably derived from [[run]]ning after an opponent while facing their rear ([[ass]]). Used in game types such as [[w:Capture the Flag|Capture the Flag]] in which, once two players have passed one other, they should go for the flag. A player who turns round and follows an opponent is only hunting for [[frag]]s, hence arserunning is frowned upon.

===Transitive verb===
'''to assrun''' ('''assrunning''', '''assran''', '''assrun''')

#(''US'') To follow (and shoot at) (somebody in a [[first-person]] [[shooter game]] after having passed them).
#:''One of your players assran me at every opportunity.''

===Intransitive verb===
'''to assrun''' ('''assrunning''', '''assran''', '''assrun''')

#(''US'') To follow (and shoot at) opponents in a first-person shooter game after having passed them.
#:''You were assrunning for the whole game.''
