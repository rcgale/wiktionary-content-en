The relative size of ocean surface over which wind in a certain direction will blow, causing wave action (nautical term).  Example:  A nor'easter off the eastern coast of Massachusetts can cause damaging wave action in Cape Cod Bay, because of the large fetch of ocean provided by the Gulf of Maine and Massachusetts Bay.
