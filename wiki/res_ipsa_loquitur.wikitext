L., "the thing speaks for itself."  A doctrine in [[tort]] cases that shifts the [[burden of proof]] to the [[defendant]], when the very fact that an accident has occurred implies that the defendant was [[negligence|negligent]].

The doctrine was famously invoked in the 19th century English case ''Byrne v. Boadle'', which involved a barrel of flour falling from a storehouse window onto a pedestrian.

Sometimes shortened to ''res ipsa'', or termed ''resipsy.''
