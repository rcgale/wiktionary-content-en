'''Mullet''' in [[slang]] refers to a person who mindlessly follows a [[fad]], a trend, or a [[leader]] (similar to the older slang term "[[lemming]]"). The phrase "stunned mullet" expresses the absence of [[vivacity]] and discernment of such a person. The allusion here is most likely to the [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], a nearshore schooling fish with rather large, blank-staring eyes; the term may also have gained some currency with the popularization of the term ''mullet'' for a [[mullet (haircut)|particular type of haircut]] claimed to be favored by the undiscerning and uneducated.
