===Noun===
'''mullet''' (plural: mullet, [[mullets]])

# (plural: mullet) A fish of Genus ''[[Mugil]]''.
# (plural: [[mullets]]) A hairstyle where the hair is kept short in front and long in the back.
#''(slang)'': A person who mindlessly follows a [[fad]], a trend, or a [[leader]] (similar to the older slang term "[[w:lemming|lemming]]").  The phrase "stunned mullet" expresses the absence of [[vivacity]] and discernment of such a person. The allusion here is most likely to the [[w:Mullet (fish)|mullet]], a nearshore schooling fish with rather large, blank-staring eyes; the term may also have gained some currency with the popularization of the term ''mullet'' for a [[w:mullet (haircut)|particular type of haircut]] claimed to be favored by the undiscerning and uneducated.
