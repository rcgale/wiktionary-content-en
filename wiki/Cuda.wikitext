Cuda is also a surname of two distinct national origins: Czechoslavakian and Italian.

'''Czechoslavakian Origin'''
In what used to be [[Czechoslovakia]] (which is now known as the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]) Cuda is pronounced "Chew' duh" with the emphasis on the first syllable, but its pronunciation varies from country to country, based on local preference.  In [[Slovak]] countries, cuda (and cudo, in Croatian) means "[[miracle]]."  It also can mean wonderful and prodigy.

'''Italian Origin'''
The Italian surname hails from region of [[Calabria]], which is located at the "toe" of the "boot" of Italy.  It is derived from the Calabresian "cauda," which is derived from the [[Latin]] "[[coda]]," which means "toward the tail."
