====Usage Note====
As ''down'' may be used as a preposition or adverb in its own right, the combination ''go down'' may also occur in cases where ''go'' is used literally.  For example, ''down the street'' means "away from the speaker along the street in question" regardless of whether ''go'' is present:

* ''She lives down the street.''
* ''Go down the street to get to her house.''

Idioms such as these are properly considered senses of [[down]].
