Caffeinism is poisoning resulting from intake of [[caffeine]], whether via coffee, tea, chocolate, soft drinks, over-the-counter medications, or other caffeine-containing products. Its symptoms are both physiological and psychological. The amount of caffeine needed to generate caffeinism varies with the individual, but may be less than one soda or cup of coffee a day.

Caffeinism mimics a number of illnesses, including [[anxiety]], [[attention deficit]], [[bipolar]] and [[personality disorders]]. This, along with the fact that it may destroy the victim's self-awareness, rendering her oblivious to her symptoms, can make it difficult to diagnose. Doctors unfamiliar with caffeinism may mistake it for one of the disorders above.

In acute cases, the patient descends into a psychosis more commonly associated with illicit drugs, which medication is powerless to cure as long as she remains intoxicated.
