# In legal terms a ‘'''riparian right'''’ is defined as the right of one who owns the land by the river, stream or creek, to have access to and use of the shore and water.  For example, to have the right to use water for household purposes and for the watering of a domestic garden, although the precise definition varies between jurisdictions.  A riparian right may also embody the absolute right to control and use water in a stream or creek or cover fishing rights.
