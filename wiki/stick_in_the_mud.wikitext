'''Stick in the mud''' is an [[idiom]] used to describe a person who doesn't want to participate in activities suggested by one or more people, usually because they thought their [[idea]] was better, yet ignored, or because they believe the activity isn't wholly [[kosher]].
More generally, one who is slow, old-fashioned, or unprogressive: an [[old fogey]]. See [[List of idioms]] for more information.

The origin of the phrase seems to relate to wagons' getting "stuck in the mud," not to a literal stick of wood.
