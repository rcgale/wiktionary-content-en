* [[-に]] ''into''
*:In the sense of ''to'', the particle へ is quite similar to the particle に (''into''), and they are often interchangeable, though there is always a slight difference of connotation or emphasis.  When using へ in a sentence such as "銀行へ行った。" (ぎんこうへいった。; ''ginkō e itta.''; ''[I] went to the bank.''), the emphasis is on getting to the location of the bank, rather than on going into the bank.  To emphasize going into the bank, you would use the particle に: "銀行に行った。" (ぎんこうにいった。; ''ginkō ni itta.''; ''[I] went to the bank.'').  The distinction isn't quite the same as between ''to'' and ''into'' in English; in most cases, the use of に to emphasize going into a place, would still be translated as ''to'', rather than ''into''.  This is because に, unlike ''into'' in English, can refer to the journey ''to'' the place in addition to the ''entering'' of the place.
