Citing "Wyrd Sisters" by Terry Pratchet:
"Your civic pride does you credit," said Hwel. "And now, please, leave the cart. I'm sure you've got some wood to gather. Lawks."

The "Lawks" here is used often as some kind of traditional exclamation.

'''This is not real entry''' I have no idea what "lawks" is... Are?..
