1. The belief that priests can act as mediators between humans and god.

Most religions put their clergy up on a pedestal. During the Protestant Reformation Martin Luther was a counter to sacerdotalism in the catholic church. We don't need pastors or priests to come to god and confess. We could go directly ourselves.

Priesthood (presbyter) is never used in the new testament to refer to one single person. It refers to a group of people. Everyone who is baptized is essential a priest. A priest is someone who is called to perform '''sacerdotalism'''.
