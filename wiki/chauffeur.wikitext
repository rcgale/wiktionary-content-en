A chauffeur is someone who is hired to drive a personal automobile.  This is a luxury usually only afforded to the rich, who can afford servants, and having one is considered to be extravagant.  

The term is also commonly used in more personal contexts:

"I'll be your chauffeur for the nights."  
or
"What am I?  Your personal chauffeur?!" 

are all commonly heard phrases that one would most likely say with a touch of sarcasm.  Sarcasm in the sense that the term chauffeur would be taken in the pejorative due to the servitile nature of the position.
