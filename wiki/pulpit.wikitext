===[[Etymology]]===

From the [[Latin]] ''pulpitum'' platorm.

# a [[raised]] [[platorm]] in a [[church]], usually [[enclosed]], where the [[minister]] or [[preacher]] stands to conduct the [[sermon]].
# the railing at the [[bow]] of a boat, which sometimes extends past the [[deck]].  It is sometimes referred to as ''bow'' ''pulpit''.  The railing at the [[stern]] of the boat is sometimes referred to as as ''[[stern]]'' ''pulpit''; other texts use the perhaps more-appropriate term ''[[pushpit]]''.
