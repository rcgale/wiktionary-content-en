'''baptism''' ([[uncountable]] and [[countable]]; plural: [[baptisms]])

The act, experience and process of using water in a significant religious ceremony.

Usually used in a [[Christian]] context based upon the original [[Jewish]] [[mikvah]] context.

The exact form of using water depends upon the Christian context, but can include
sprinkling on the head, pouring over the head, dunking the head in a basin, and 
immersion of the entire body in a river or vessel such as a baptistry.

Much of the exact details of the ceremony may depend on the particular religious 
denomination. In some groups, baptism is considered a [[sacrament]], and in others,
it is considered an [[ordinance]] of Jesus Christ.

It is common that baptism is associated with [[repentance]], removing the impurity of [[sin]], 
physical [[birth]], spiritual re-birth and/or with Christian [[conversion]].

Baptism often is associated with prayers, benedictions, and blessings.  It is
common that when it is in the form of [[Christening]], that baptism also involves
an oath by [[godparents]] to aid the [[godchild]] in their life endeavors.
