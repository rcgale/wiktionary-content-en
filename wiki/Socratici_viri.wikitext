'''Socratici viri''' is a [[Latin phrase]] which translates as ''Socrates' men'' - though it is more usually used to mean ''disciples of Socrates'' or ''followers of Socrates''. These are those, usually Greeks, who owe a lot of their philosophical reasoning and method to [[Socrates]]. Sometimes the phrase just refers to those in the [[Socratic dialogue]]s and especially [[Plato]] - though it may be extended to modern day followers of Socrates.
