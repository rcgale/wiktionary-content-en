The term '''postwhore''' refers to a [[message board]] user who regularly posts comments usually seen as useless, like "[[me too]]". Usually the purpose is to accumulate large numbers of posts in a short amount of time, either for bragging rights or to take advantage of certain board features that reward high [[postcount]]s.
