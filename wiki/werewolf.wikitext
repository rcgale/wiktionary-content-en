====Etymology====
From [[Old English]] '''[[werewulf]]''', from Germanic '''[[were]]''' ''man'' (akin to Latin '''[[vir]]''') + '''[[wulf]]''' ''wolf''

====Historical Note====
The myth probably originates with the disease [[w:Lupus Erythematosus|lupus erythematosus]] , which causes afflicted people to grow extra hair and avoid sunlight.  "[[Lupus]]" is [[Latin]] for "wolf".  The [[vampire]] myth may have the same origin.
