===Noun===

# (''mythology'') A [[person]] who is [[transform]]ed into a [[wolf]] when there is a [[full moon]].

*[[lycanthrope]]
*[[neurian]]
*[[wolfman]]

====Historical note====
Some people have speculated that the myth originates from the disease [[w:Lupus erythematosus|lupus erythematosus]], which they mistakenly claim causes those afflicted to grow extra hair and to shun sunlight.  In fact, the root upon which the name of the disease is based, "[[lupus]]", is [[Latin]] for "wolf", not "were-wolf".  Some have also speculated, with as little basis, that the [[vampire]] myth has a similar origin.
