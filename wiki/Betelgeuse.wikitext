===Etymology===
The name is a corruption of the [[Arabic]] &#1610;&#1583; &#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1608;&#1586;&#1575;, ''yad al-jawz&#257;'', or "hand of the central one". ''Jauza'', ''the central one'', initially referred to [[Gemini]] among the Arabs, but at some point they decided to refer to Orion by that name. During the [[Middle Ages]] the first character of the name, ''y'' ('''&#65268;''', with two dots under it), was misread as a ''b'' ('''&#65170;''', with one dot under it) when transliterating into [[Latin]], and ''Yad al-Jauza'' became ''Bedalgeuze''. Then, during the [[Renaissance]], someone tried to derive the original Arabic from this corrupted name, and decided that it was originally written as ''Bait al-Jauza''. This imaginative person then declared that ''Bait'' meant "armpit" in Arabic, to the surprise of Arabs everywhere. The nameless Renaissance linguist then "corrected" the transliterated spelling to ''Betelgeuse'', and the modern rendering was born. In order for Betelgeuse to have meant "armpit of the central one", the original rendering would have to have been &#1575;&#1576;&#1591; ''Ib&#355; (al-Jauza)''.
