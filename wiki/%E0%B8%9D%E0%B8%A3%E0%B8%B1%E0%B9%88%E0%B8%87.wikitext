==Thai==
'''ฝรั่ง''' (farang)

# [[foreigner]]. Generally used to describe Caucasians and people with features of European descent. People from other Asian countries are called by their country of origin. People with features of African descent will sometimes be referred to as 'black farang' but more often are called 'Africa'. In Thai social order it is not respectful to use the word farang with someone known to an individual otherwise no malice is intended.
