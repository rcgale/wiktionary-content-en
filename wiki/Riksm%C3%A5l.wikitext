'''Riksmål''' (or Traditional Standard Norwegian) is a variant of the [[Norwegian]] language, based on the [[Danish]] written language. It is more closer to Danish than [[Bokmål]] and [[Nynorsk]]. Although Riksmål have been the most widely written language in Norway, it is not an official language of the country.
