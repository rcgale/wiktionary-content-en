#A neutrino is a particle that possesses a small mass (believed to be zero) and has 1/2 spin.  It is unaffected by [[electromagnetism]] or the [[strong nuclear]] force, but can be affected by [[weak nuclear]] or [[gravity]] forces.  Due to its weak interaction, it is believed that it can only be stopped by a [[light year]] of lead shielding.  Known neutrinos are associated with a [[lepton]].
