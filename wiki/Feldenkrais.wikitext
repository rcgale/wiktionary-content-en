The word Feldenkrais has begun to be used throughout the World, as a shorthand for The Feldenkrais Method, which is a registered mark. Moshe Feldenkrais 1904-1984 originated the work, which has two movement system behaviour components called Functional Integration, and Awareness Through Movement. Feldenkrais organised his first trainings in the 1960's and now there are thousands of practitioners of The Feldenkrais Method in many countries. The work enables optimization of human performance, and therefore has applications in health, education, and self development.
