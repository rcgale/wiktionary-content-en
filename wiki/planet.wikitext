===Etymology===
From Greek '''[[planetes]]''', ''wanderer''

===Noun===
#According to the [http://www.iau.org/ International Astronomical Union], any of the objects [[Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], and [[Pluto]], irregardless of finding a succinct definition that matches exactly these nine bodies without leaving any out or including other objects in the Solar system.
#A celestial object that
## Orbits the central star directly, not another body.
## Is not be massive enough to allow nuclear fusion in its core.
## Be massive enough that its own gravity presses it into a roughly circular shape.
## Is not part of a group of similar objects with overlapping orbits such as the [[asteroid belt]].
#A [http://www.ciw.edu/IAU/div3/wgesp/definition.html working definition] by the International Astronomical Union states that a companion to a star that is smaller than required for the fusion of deuterium, estimated at 13 Jupiter masses is termed a planet.  (But see usage note below).

#(Colloquial or Jargon) A celestrial object that is like a planet, and unlike the typical moon etc., in one&rsquo;s field of study, without concern as to its orbit.  (See usage notes below.)  Careful speakers
use the term [world] instead.



              <!-- Careful not to be an encyclopedia:
stick with how people use the word planet, not
with the history etc.  Obviously this does tie
into what a planet _is_, since that is the
word's meaning!  But, here I discuss quibbling 
and contravery of the _word_, not the object
itself.  So it belongs here, not Wikipedia. -->




====Usage Notes====
Any simple definition of &ldquo;planet&rdquo; will not name only and exactly the nine planets in our solar system.  This is partly historical accident and long precident, giving rise to the current contraversy over [[Pluto]].  For example, when [[Ceres]] was discovered it was called a planet.  But, when it was discovered not to be alone, a new term was invented&mdash;[[asteroid]]&mdash;and the designation of planet revoked.  When Pluto was discovered to be not alone, it had been called a planet for generations and cultural inertia gives us the explicit first definition.

Sometimes other celestrial bodies are called planets either colloquially or as technical jargon in some discipline.  For example, a geologist would care about the physical properties of the object and not care anything at all about how to get there.  For example,

*''Our angle is that Titan is basically another terrestrial planet, but it&rsquo;s often not recognized as one because it happens to be orbiting Saturn.'' &mdash;[http://www.spacedaily.com/news/saturn-titan-04o.html Dr. Vikki Meadows], an astrobiologist at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Dr. Meadows was pointing out that the term ''terrestrial planet'' as it is used in astrobiology applies to Titan, even though that is counterintuitive from the name of the term and the proper meaning of ''planet''.  [[Titan]], [[Europa]], and other large moons with interesting active geologic processes are sometimes accidently called planets in this way.

Meanwhile, the Working Group on Extrasolar Planets distinguishes planets from the larger brown dwarfs and objects that are free-floating rather than companions.  But for a lower limit it specifies &ldquo;The minimum mass/size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in our Solar System.&rdquo;.  However, there is no accepted definition of planet for our solar system that is based on size.  When another [[Kuiper Belt]] Object is found that is larger than Pluto, this issue may come to a head.  It&rsquo;s moot for extrasolar planets anyway since only very large ones can currently be detected.
