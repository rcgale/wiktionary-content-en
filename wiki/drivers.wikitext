==Drivers==

'''Noun, plural''', ''Computer terminology''

#In computer terminology, a '''driver''' is a special [[program]] that acts as an [[interface]] between the [[application]] program and the [[computer]] [[hardware]]. Drivers are written specifically for the hardware device they control. For example, if a word processor sends a print request, that request goes to the ''[[printer]] driver'' which "knows" what instructions must be added to the file in order for the printer to handle it correctly. 

Most computer systems use a string of drivers that handle the various tasks which must occur "behind the scenes" for applications to work properly.
