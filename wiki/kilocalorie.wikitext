'''kilocalorie'''  (plural ''kilocalories'')
# a non-[[SI]] unit of [[energy]] equal to 1,000 [[calories]], used in [[chemistry]] or [[physics]]; equal to 1 [[calorie]] or  [[Calorie]] as used in [[nutrition]].

'''Usage note:'''  This prefix [[kilo-]] is generally applied to the small calorie, and not to the large calorie used in nutrition, to avoid confusion because 1,000 food calories would be 1,000,000 small calories.
