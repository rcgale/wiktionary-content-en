===Proper noun===
'''[[New]] [[York]] [[State]]'''
# The state of [[New York]].  Postal abbreviation: [[NY]].  "New York State" is used more often than "New York", since it must be distinguished from [[New York City]].  To say "[[NY, NY]]" or "[[NYC]]" or "[[New York, New York]]" is not ambiguous, but to say "[[NY]]" is.
