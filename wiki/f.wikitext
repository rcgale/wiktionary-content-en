===Letter===
#F is the [[sixth]] letter of the [[[[Wiktionary:About Roman script|English alphabet]], and a [[nonvocal]] consonant. Its form and sound are from the Latin. The Latin [[borrowed]] the form from the Greek [[digamma]] &#988;, which probably had the value of English ''w'' consonant. The form and value of Greek letter came from the [[Ph&oelig;nician]], the ultimate source being probably Egyptian. 
#:[[Etymologically]] ''f'' is most closely related to ''p'', ''k'', ''v'', and ''b''; as in English ''f''ive from Greek pe`nte; English wol''f'', from Latin lu''p''us, and Greek ly`kos; English ''f''ox, ''v''ixen ; ''f''ragile, ''b''reak; ''f''ruit, ''b''rook; English verb ''b''ear, from Latin ''f''erre.
