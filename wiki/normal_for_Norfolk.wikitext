'''Normal for Norfolk''' (or '''NFN''') is an [[England|English]] [[slang]] term for something that is peculiar, or weird.

The term comes from an [[urban myth]] that [[Social Service]]s in [[Norfolk]] used to record the letters 'NFN' against the personal details of certain [[client]]s, where they were considered to be a bit strange or had peculiar habits.  According to the urban myth, such clients were so common in that area that they were considered normal as far as Norfolk was concerned.

The term is considered derogatory because it portrays people from Norfolk as normally being strange, or peculiar.  The portrayal of people from Norfolk in this light is a common [[stereotype]] in England.
