a prosthologist is someone skilled in the making of [[prosthesis|prostheses]].  There are audio prosthologists, which specialize in installing hearing aids and cochlear implants, and dental prosthologists, who specialize in replacements for missing teeth.  Dental prosthologists, though, seem to be more often referred to as master dental technicians.
