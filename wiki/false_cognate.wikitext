==English==
===Noun Phrase===
'''[[false]] [[cognate]]''' (''plural'' '''false cognates''')

# A word that appears to be [[cognate]] to a given word but is in fact unrelated.

===Examples===
# The word for "dog" in the Australian Aboriginal language Mbabaram happens to be ''dog''.
# The Korean word for "two" happens to be ''tu''.
# Many completely unrelated languages use some variant of ''ma'' for "mother".
# English ''have'' and Latin ''habere'' are thought to be false cognates (''have'' is more likely cognate to ''capere'').

===Usage Note===

False cognates are much rarer than [[false friend]]s, and the term ''false cognate'' is sometimes misapplied to false friends.  For example, an earlier version of this article had cited French ''attendre'' and English ''attend'' as false cognates.  They are in fact true cognates, derived from the same Latin roots, but false friends, their meanings having diverged.
