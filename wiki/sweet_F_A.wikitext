S.F.A. SWEET FUCK ALL or  SWEET FANNY ADAMS, S.F.A. Nothing at all. 

Originally nineteenth century naval slang for tinned cooked meat, from the notorious murder and dismemberment of a girl named FANNY ADAMS. The initials S.F.A. were, by the time of the Great War, also allocated to the expression Sweet Fuck-All, and Sweet Fanny Adams was a bowdlerised version of this phrase.
