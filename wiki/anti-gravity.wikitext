Relates to a process and an installation for generating a positive or a negative gravitational field through the movement of electrons for the generation of levitational effects. 

  For some industrial processes it is desirable to exclude gravitational forces during the production of specific products since these decrease the product quality.  Specific operating sequences could be carried out simpler if it were possible to reduce the gravitational forces at least to a considerable degree.  Until now the only possibility to do so was traveling into space on board of spacecraft since here freedom from gravitation is given.  However, due to the expenses, the distance from all ground-based supply equipment and due to the small spatial dimensions of such spacecraft as well as for a number of other reasons, this is not feasible for industrial applications; only a few research projects can be carried out under the conditions required for this purpose.  For this reason, any possibility of reducing gravitational forces here on earth is of great significance
