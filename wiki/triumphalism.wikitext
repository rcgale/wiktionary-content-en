\'''Triumphalism'''\ is the attitude or belief that a particular [[doctrine]], [[culture]], or social group--particularly a religious or political one--is superior to all others.

Triumphalism is not itself a doctrine. It is discussed in cautionary tones (when addressing one’s own group) or in [[accusatory]] tones (when speaking about others’ groups.)

Humans exhibit triumphalism in [[innocuous]] forms such as collective pride (as in school spirit) or in joyful sports fanaticism (“''We’re Number One!''”). The word 'triumphalism' is sometimes used to refer to excessive glee expressed at the defeat of a rival.

In its more [[consequential]] forms, triumphalism can feel good to those who experience it, as with patriotism or pride. However, the dangers of triumphalism to one’s own group include:<ul><li>
<li>Impaired ability to judge the value or morality of the group's actions ("''If we're doing it, it must not be wrong.''"); 
<li>Cessation of creativity and innovation within the group ("''We're the best, so we need to stay exactly the way we are and must not change.'' "); 
<li>Blindness to other groups’ strengths and innovations ("''We need not attend to other groups, because we have nothing to learn from them.''"); 
<li>Inattention to internal weaknesses and to changing circumstances that affect the welfare of the group, perhaps due to psychological [[denial]] or to a false sense of security, control, or invulnerability; and 
<li>A tendency to over-reach against the group’s competitors, based on an inflated sense of the likelihood of triumph in conflict.</ul> 


The dangers of triumphalism to other groups include:<ul>
<li>Attempts at domination or silencing of other groups; and 
<li>Damage to shared resources inflicted by groups that do not perceive other groups’ interests to be as valid or legitimate as their own.</ul>
