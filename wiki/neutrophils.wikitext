'''Neutrophils''', also known as '''polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leucocytes''', are the mayor class of white blood cell in human peripheral blood. They have a multilobed nucleus and neutrophilic granules. Neutrophils are '''phagoctes''' and have an important role in engulfing and killing extracellular pathogens.
