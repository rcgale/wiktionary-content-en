'''Shanks' mare''' is an [[idiom]] meaning to walk; to "travel by shanks' mare" or "ride on shanks' mare" is to walk to your destination. Older forms of the phrase include '''Shanks' nag''' and '''Shanks' pony''', using different terms for horses.

The shank is the lower part of the leg, now more commonly referred to as the [[calf (anatomy)|calf]]; hence the term references travelling "by leg".

It was first recorded as "shanks-nag", in [[1785]].
