[[Shanks]]'s [[pony]] means to [[walk]]. So, if you go somewhere by Shanks's pony, you walk there.

Shanks is both a surname and an old word for 'legs', so the expression is a [[jocular]] punning [[metaphor]] for 'on a means of conveyance consisting of one's own legs'. It was originally [[Scottish]], first recorded in the early [[16th century]] and probably older even than that.
