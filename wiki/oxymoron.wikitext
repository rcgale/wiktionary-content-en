'''Oxymoron''', ''[[noun (part of speech)|noun]]''

Oxymoron is an ancient word which came into recent prominence as a result of a bet between two Time magazine writers that each would pay the other in booze for each outrageous word included in their articles in the magazine  Anybody: do you have the names of the two guys?  The other word that made it into mass circulation through this jape was "lagniappe."

Oxymoron does not mean contradiction, though it is often and ignorantly used as if it did. The etymology is from the Greek moronos, which means silly or stupid, and oxy- or pointed. On the Greek stage the word meant "making a point through a silly combination." In modern English it means the construction of a new meaning out of apparently contradictory parts, the traditional example being "bittersweet."

One way to understand it is, "oxymoron is to contradiction as synthesis is to antithesis." An oxymoron bears a new meaning, not two old ones at loggerheads. It should perhaps be noted that "`Military intelligence' is an oxymoron" is a joke, not a defining example of the word's use.

"Lagniappe," incidentally has had a hard time coming into the wide world under Time's auspices. It is usually misused to mean "a freebie," but in fact the original example of the word, from the Louisiana French, is something "given" compulsorily, but charged for, e.g. the hard rolls at a New Orleans clam house.
