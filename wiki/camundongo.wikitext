'''CAMUNDONGO''' is a brazilian word for mouse (the animal). The computer mouse is said MOUSE, as in English. Some Brazilians may use RATINHO ('ratty' or 'little rat') for CAMUNDONGO in informal speech, but '''CAMUNDONGO''' is generally considered more correct term in biology and medicine. Some Brazilians would use the word '''CAMUNDONGO''' even in informal situations. There is an alternative spelling (''CAMONDONGO''), but it is objected to, by some, and, therefore, generally avoided. The word '''CAMUNDONGO''' is a Brazilian Portuguese word of Angolan origin (it came from the Angolan language KIMBUNDO).
