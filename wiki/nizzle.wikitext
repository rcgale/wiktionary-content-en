===Noun===
'''nizzle'''

# {{cattag2|Slang|US}}: [[nigga|Nigga]], another slang term used as a euphemism or familiar adaptation to the derogative term [[Nigger]], utilized during the time period immediately before and during the Civil War in reference to slaves brought over from Black Africa. The word "Nigger" is still used in some circles, particularly elitist or racist ones, but is considered to be very offensive. The words "nizzle" and "nigga" are not especially harmful, as is their root word, but remain to be only definitely accepted when said by a descendant (particularly of black skin color) of those slaves freed at the resolution of the Civil War.
