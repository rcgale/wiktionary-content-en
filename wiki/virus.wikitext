===Noun===
'''virus''' ([[viruses]])

#A core of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] surrounded by a [[protein]] coat that requires a living cell to reproduce &mdash; often causes disease in the host organism.
#A [[computer virus]].

====Usage note====
The standard plural is ''viruses''.  A new plural, ''virii'' has emerged for use in the computing sense.  This is currently non-standard, and ''viruses'' is still the preferred plural in all senses of the word. One risks giving the impression of illiteracy in two languages by using ''virii''.

*(''computing''): [[computer virus]]
