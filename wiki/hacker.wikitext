=== Noun ===
'''hacker'''
# (''hacking'') One who is intensely interested in the technical details of a system, particularly a computer and its software.
<!-- Please do not change this to "a term commonly confused with ..." or other such.  The usage note below makes the issue abundantly clear.  In common usage, this *is* the meaning.  I don't like it either, but when a newspaper article says "a hacker broke in ..." they don't mean "a term commonly confused with cracker broke in."  They mean "a cracker broke in." --dmh -->
