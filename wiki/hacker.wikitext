==English==

=== Noun ===
'''hacker'''
# A brilliant computer user, one who possess the ability to manipulate a computer system at a very low level.  This includes but is not limited to those who possess the ability to write and understand computer programming languages, as they pertain to the operation of a computer system, and those who can read and understand machine code.
<!-- Please do not change this to "a term commonly confused with ..." or other such.  The usage note below makes the issue abundantly clear.  In common usage, this *is* the meaning.  I don't like it either, but when a newspaper article says "a hacker broke in ..." they don't mean "a term commonly confused with cracker broke in."  They mean "a cracker broke in." --dmh -->
# A [[cracker]], black hat hacker, or script kiddie:  One who circumvents the security measures of a system with malicious or criminal intent.  Someone who does not necessarily posses the afore mentioned skills.

===Usage Note===

The first sense, dating at least to the 1960's, is still current in the computing community.  However, popular usage, including news accounts and television programs, tends overwhelmingly toward the second sense.  Many in the hacker community (in the first sense) feel it is important to   promote usage of the first sense, and find the second sense offensive, particularly since computer burglary and vandalism can be and often are done without any deep understanding or significant skill.  One should, however, use the term with care in casual conversation, as it is easily misconstrued.
