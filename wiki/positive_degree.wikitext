===Noun Phrase===
'''positive degree'''

# ''(Grammar)'' that state of an adjective or adverb indicating simple quality, without comparison or relation to increase or diminution; as in ''wise'', ''noble''.

====Usage Note====
English has three degrees of comparison: positive, comparative, and superlative.  For short adjectives, English adds the suffix "'''[[-er]]'''" to an adjective to form the comparative degree, and adds "'''[[-est]]'''" to form the superlative degree.  For adjectives longer than about two syllables, and for adverbs, English precedes the word with "'''more'''" for the comparative and "'''most'''" for the superlative.
