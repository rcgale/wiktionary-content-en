#:*'''1909''': Some authorities profess to discover [[jazeraint]] work in this representation, which was a method of defence much used in later centuries for [[archer]]s' [[jacques]] and various other [[garment]]s, but we have no right to assume that the [[Norman]]s at that period carried such a [[heavy]] weight of [[armor]] as this would necessitate, or were acquainted with such a [[technical]] and [[complicate]]d manufacture as [[jazeraint]] work. &mdash; Charles Henry Ashdown, ''European Arms & Armor'', page 68.
