OE. amiral, admiral, OF. amiral, ultimately fr. Ar. amīr-al-bahr commander of the sea; Ar. amīr is commander, al is the Ar. article, and amīr-al, heard in different titles, was taken as one word. Early forms  of the word show confusion with L. admirabilis admirable, fr. admirari to admire. It is said to have been introduced into  Europe by the Genoese or Venetians, in the 12th or 13th century. Cf. {Ameer}, {Emir}
