# Known as RPG in short, Role Playing Game is a type (or genre) of console game where the player assumes the role of the main character in the game and guides the character to certain objectives and goals in the game. Certain RPG games also enable the player to "switch roles" and play the part of other characters apart from the main character. One example of role playing games is the Final Fantasy series.
