#A piece of [[armor]] for the [[thigh]]s, forming an [[appendage]] to the ancient [[corselet]]. Usually the tasse was a plate of iron [[swing]]ing from the [[cuirass]], but the [[skirt]]s of sliding [[splint]]s were also called by this name.
#:'''Quotations'''
#:*'''1786''': This included the head-piece and [[gorgett]], the back and breast, with skirts of iron called [[tasses]] or [[tasset]]s covering the thighs, as may be seen in the figures, representing the exercise of the [[pike]], published [[anno]] 1622, by the title of the Military Art of Training; the same kind of armour was worn by the [[harquebusier]]s. &mdash; Francis Grose, ''A Treatise on Ancient Armour and Weapons'', page 21.
