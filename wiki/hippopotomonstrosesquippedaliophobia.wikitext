<!--to be added-->

===Emology===
Combination of elements suggesting largeness or length, deliberately forming a word likely to induce the fear it denotes: ''hippopotomonstro-'' (irregular blend [influenced by connective ''-o-'', from French, from Latin, from Greek—connective vowel of most nouns and adjectives in combination] of [[hippopotamus]] and ''monstro-'', from Latin ''monstr-'', ''monstrum'', '''monster''') + ''sesquippedalio-'' (incorrectly formed from [[sesquipedalian]] or Latin ''sesquipedalia'', '''anatomical things one and a half feet long''') + ''[[-phobia]]'', from [[phobia]]

===Noun===

#The fear of long words.

===Usage===

*"Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia is longer than [[antidisestablishmentarianism]]"

And '''hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia''', which is fear of long words.  - anon, ''The Scotsman'' (April 9, 2002) page 13.
*'''2002''' - Those who find this column troubling are suffering from '''hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia''' - the fear of long words. Or, more likely, [[rupophobia]] - a fear of rubbish. - Chris Lloyd in ''The Northern Echo'' (December 14, 2002) page 10

In the book ''Useless Knowledge'', this enormous word was misinterpreted by the authors as two words, causing them to list the fear of long words as the following:

:hippopotomonstroses
:and quippedaliophobia

—further distortions of an already very incorrectly formed word (see [[Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia#Etymology|Etymology]] above)!
