==English==

===Etymology===
Combination of elements suggesting largeness or length, deliberately forming a word likely to induce the fear it denotes: ''hippopotomonstro-'' (irregular blend [influenced by connective ''-o-'', from French, from Latin, from Greek—connective vowel of most nouns and adjectives in combination] of [[hippopotamus]] and ''monstro-'', from Latin ''monstr-'', ''monstrum'', '''monster''') + ''sesquippedalio-'' (incorrectly formed from [[sesquipedalian]] or Latin ''sesquipedalia'', '''things one and a half feet long''') + ''[[-phobia]]'', from [[phobia]].

===Noun===
'''hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia'''

# The fear of long words.

===Usage note===

It is unlikely that this 15-syllable contrivance is ever used purely for its meaning.  The term [[sesquipedalophobia]] is recognized in formal writing, while the four-syllable phrase "fear of long words" is certainly worth considering.

In the book ''Useless Knowledge'', this enormous word was misinterpreted by the authors as two words, causing them to list the fear of long words as the following:

:hippopotomonstroses
:quippedaliophobia

These fragments appear to be quoted occasionally in other sources.

*'''2002''' - Those who find this column troubling are suffering from ''hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia'' - the fear of long words. Or, more likely, [[rupophobia]] - a fear of rubbish. - Chris Lloyd in ''The Northern Echo'' (December 14, 2002) page 10
