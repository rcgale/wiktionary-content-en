Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia - the fear of long words.


===Etymology===
Combination of elements suggesting largeness or length, deliberately forming a word likely to induce the fear it denotes: ''hippopotomonstro-'' (irregular blend [influenced by connective ''-o-'', from French, from Latin, from Greek—connective vowel of most nouns and adjectives in combination] of [[hippopotamus]] and ''monstro-'', from Latin ''monstr-'', ''monstrum'', '''monster''') + ''sesquippedalio-'' (incorrectly formed from [[sesquipedalian]] or Latin ''sesquipedalia'', '''things one and a half feet long''') + ''[[-phobia]]'', from [[phobia]].

===Usage===

* It is unlikely that this 15-syllable contrivance is ever used purely for its meaning.  The term [[sesquipedalophobia]] is recognized in formal writing, while the four-syllable phrase "fear of long words" is certainly worth considering.

===Quotations===

*'''2002''' - However, we assume that despite the best endeavours of science, some phobias will always remain. These include [[paraskavedekatriaphobia]], or fear of Friday the 13th. And '''hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia''', which is fear of long words.  - anon, ''The Scotsman'' (April 9, 2002) page 13.
*'''2002''' - Those who find this column troubling are suffering from ''hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia'' - the fear of long words. Or, more likely, [[rupophobia]] - a fear of rubbish. - Chris Lloyd in ''The Northern Echo'' (December 14, 2002) page 10

In the book ''Useless Knowledge'', this enormous word was misinterpreted by the authors as two words, causing them to list the fear of long words as the following:

:hippopotomonstroses
:and quippedaliophobia

—further distortions of an already very incorrectly formed word (see [[Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia#Etymology|Etymology]] above)!
