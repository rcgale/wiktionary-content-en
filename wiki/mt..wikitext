====Usage notes====
<!--Disputed:
*In UK usage, the full word is generally preferred for the names of towns.
As the abbreviation for definition 2 only eliminates the use of two characters, the full word, [[Mount]], is generally preferred.  It is also never appropriate to use this abbreviation in body text in any form.  The same applies to [[Ft.|Ft]] for [[Fort]], [[So.]] for [[South]], and [[No.]] for [[North]].  Use of Mt is only appropriate when space necessitates.
