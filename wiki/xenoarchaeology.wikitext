Xenoarchelogy is a fictional science that exists only in [[science fiction]] worlds, mainly in works that have to do with space exploration like [[Star Trek]]. The name comes from [[Greek]] Xenos (&#958;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;) which means 'stranger, alien', and archeology 'study of ancients'. 

Xenoarcheology is concerned with deserted planets which have been inhabited by aliens (who eventually were extinct or left) before the coming of human explorers or colonists, and the remnants they left (ruins, ancient technology etc).
