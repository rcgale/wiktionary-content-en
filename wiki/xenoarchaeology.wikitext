'''Xenoarcheology''' is a fictional [[science]] that exists only in [[science fiction]] worlds, mainly in works that have to do with [[space exploration]] like [[Star Trek]]. The name comes from [[Greek]] Xenos (&#958;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;) which means 'stranger, [[alien]]', and [[archeology]] 'study of ancients'. 

Xenoarcheology is concerned with deserted [[planet]]s which have been inhabited by [[alien]]s (who eventually were extinct or left) before the coming of human explorers or colonists, and the remnants they left (ruins, ancient technology, etc).
