Xenoarchelogy is a fictional science that exists only in [[science fiction]] worlds, mainly in works that have to do with space exploration like [[Star Trek]]. The name comes from [[Greek]] Xenos (&#958;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;) which means 'stranger, alien', and archeology 'study of ancients'. It is the study of ancient alien civilisations that inhabited deserted planets, before their extinction or departure.
