'''[[Hungarian]] [[notation]]'''
# {{computing}}: A naming convention in computer [[programming]], in which the name of a [[variable]], usually mixed-case, indicates its type and intended use by including obscure abbreviations as prefixes.

===Usage note===
Upper case characters indicate the start of a new token, abbreviation or "word" in Hungarian Notation.  Specific rules on notation vary for each programming team (much much more detail can be found on Wikipedia regarding this) and therefore is often considered to be a dangerous practice.
