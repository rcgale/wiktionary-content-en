In [[business]], a '''Chinese wall''' is a means used to make sure that different parts of the firm are kept separate so that [[information]] does not circulate freely and to prevent [[conflicts of interest]].  
The term is especially common in areas such as [[brokerage]], [[law]] firms and [[management]] consulting.

The term was coined in the United States following the [[stock market]] [[crash of 1929]], in reference to the [[Great Wall of China]].
The U.S. government saw the Chinese wall as a means to provide separation (or an information barrier) between [[investment bank]]ers and brokerage firms.
This was intended to limit the conflict of interest between objective analysis of companies and the desire to have a successful [[initial public offering]]s.

The Chinese wall is also used in law firms in situations where one part of the firm, which is representing a party on a deal or [[litigation]], is separate from another part of the firm that might otherwise have an adverse effect on the party's interests.

The term is also used in [[journalism]] to describe the separation between the editorial and [[advertising]] arms of a media firm.
The Chinese wall is regarded as breached for [[advertorial]] projects.

In [[computer science]], Chinese wall refers to a [[reverse engineering]] method involving two separate groups.  One group reverse-engineers the original code and writes thorough documentation, while the other group writes new code based only on the documentation.  The first group never writes new code, and the second group never looks at the original code.  This method insulates the new code from the old code, so that the new code is not considered a derived work of the old code.
