A '''Chinese wall''' is a term used in business (and especially brokerage and law firms) to make sure that different parts of the firm are kept separate so that information does not circulate freely and prevent conflicts of interest.  

It was coined in the United States after the "[[Great Wall of China]]," following the [[stock market]] [[crash of 1929]].  The U.S. Government saw it as a means to provide separation (or an information barrier) between investment bankers and '''brokerage firms'''. This was intended to limit the conflict of interest between objective analysis of companies and the desire to have a successful initial public offerings.

It is also used in '''law firms''' to apply to situations where one part of the firm is working on a deal or litigation that is separate from another part of the firm that might otherwise have an adverse effect on the party's interests.

The term is also used in '''[[journalism]]''' to describe the separation between the editorial and advertising arms of a media firm. The Chinese wall is regarded as breached for so-called [[advertorial]] projects.
