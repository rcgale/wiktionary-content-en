==English==
===Pronunciation===
*[[IPA]]: /krʌŋk/
*[[SAMPA]]: /krVNk/

===Etymology===
There is no evidence "crunk" comes from the Yiddish and German words meaning "sick" or "ill" ("krank" in both languages), despite the phonetic similarity of the words (see [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001511.html this LanguageLog post] for information on the high probability of chance similarity among languages). Nor is there any evidence it was brought into the Southern Black vernacular through the presence of European Jewish immigrant shopkeepers in black neighborhoods in cities such as Atlanta. More likely, and more often claimed, is that it is a combination of "crazy" and "drunk" or that it indicates a state in which the user is simultaneously drunk and high on marijuana. Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz were early popularizers of the term in the 1990s.
