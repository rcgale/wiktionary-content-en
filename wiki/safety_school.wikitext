In the college admission process in the [[United States]], a '''safety school''' is a [[university]] or [[college]] that an applicant judges to have an almost perfect chance of being accepted to. Generally, safety schools have lower criteria than the [[student]] looks for - the student only applies to the school just in case he/she is rejected from all other colleges that he/she applies to.
