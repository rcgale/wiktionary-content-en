===Etymology===
The earliest recorded example of mooncalf was in a thesaurus of 1565, in which the term was explicitly applied to a woman. The reference here was to a false pregnancy, to a growth in the womb that was not a foetus. -- [http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-moo2.htm Michael Quinion]

By 1614 it had evolved to mean someone under the influence of the moon.
