Historically, '''janner''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[slang]] term used to describe a person who lives within sight of the sea. More recently, the term has evolved to describe a person from the city of [[Plymouth]] in south-west [[Devon]], and the dialect and accent of that person. '''Janner''' is to [[Plymouth]] what [[Scouse]] is to [[Liverpool]].

'''Janner''' can also to refer to a farmer, with a 'janner' being a stereotypical view of a farmer or person who lives in the countryside. Example: "That janner's got some fine cows!"

When '''janner''' is used to describe a stereotypical person from [[Plymouth]] it generally has negative or perjorative connotations.  Stereotypically, a janner is often clothed in poor quality clothing bought from the city's indoor market, combined with a large selection of very cheap 'gold' jewellery; a janner might live on state benefits and maintains three or four young children fathered by different men met on nights out drinking [[White Lightning]] [[cider]] at the ''Jester's'' night club in [[Plymouth]]'s Union Street.
