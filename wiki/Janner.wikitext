Historically, '''Janner''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] slang term used to describe a person who lives within sight of the sea. More recently the term has evolved to describe a person from the City of [[Plymouth]] in South-west [[Devon]].

The term '''Janner''' can also to refer to a farmer, with a 'Janner' being a stereotypical view of a farmer or person who lives in the countryside. Example: "That Janners got some fine cows!"

More recently 'Janner' has been used to describe a particular type of person from the city.  Often clothed in poor quality clothing purchased from Plymouth's indoor market, combined with a large selection of very cheap 'gold' jewellery. Typically a janner ,aided purely by benefits, will maintain three or four young children, fathered by various men met on nights out drinking white lightening cider at the 'Jester's' night club in Union Street.

This 'modern' janner was brought to national attention in 2001 when the News of the World newspaper published the names of local child molesters. On national television a number of modern janners were seen to be throwing stones at homes of local child specialists, due to an honest reading mistake.
