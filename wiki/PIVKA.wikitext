Proteins induced by Vitamin K absence (or antagonist)

Several of the proteins requiring for normal blood clotting (factors II, VII, IX and X) are synthesized by the liver in an inactive form and need to undergo a chemical modification called carboxylation to become functional. This process requires vitamin K as a co-factor, if vitamin K is absent or its action is blocked the inactive forms of the proteins build up - these are known as PIVKA.
