* '''1774''': The meaning of the word ''' ''Gabion,'' ''' as it is used in the poem, is not to be sought for in any dictionary.  It was of the venerable old gentleman Mr Ruthven's own coining, and it was well enough understood among his select friends, to mean nothing else but the miscellaneous curiosities in his closet humorously described in the poem. &mdash; James Cant, introduction to ''The Muses Threnodie'' p. vi, quoted and cited in ''Reliquiae Trotcosiensis'' by Sir Walter Scott (p.6 of the 2004, Edinburgh University Press edition)
* Reliquiae Trotcosienses: Or, the '''Gabions''' of the Late Jonathan Oldbuck Esq. of Monkbarns &mdash; title of unfinished novel by Sir Walter Scott
