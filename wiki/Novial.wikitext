'''Noun'''

'''Novial'''

An interlanguage. An international auxiliary language.

An interlanguage published by the Danish linguist, Professor Otto Jespersen in 1928.

Novial  =  '''''Nov International Auxiliari Lingue''''' 
(New International Auxiliary Language).

Novial is more similar than Esperanto to the Romance languages and English in terms of its vocabulary. It is also grammatically simpler, having an analytical structure like English.

It is based on the Romance languages, English, German, Latin and Scandinavian languages.
