We speak of a thing as ''accidental'' when it falls out as by chance, and not in the regular course of things; as, an ''accidental'' meeting, an ''accidental'' advantage, etc. We call a thing ''incidental'' when it falls, as it were, ''into'' some regular course of things, but is secondary, and forms no essential part [[thereof]]; as, an ''incremental'' remark, an ''incidental'' evil, an ''incidental'' benefit. We speak of a thing as ''casual'', when it falls out or happens, as it were, by mere chance, without being [[prearranged]] or [[premeditated]]; as, a ''casual'' remark or encounter; a ''casual'' [[observer]]. An idea of the [[unimportant]] is attached to what is ''casual''. ''Fortuitous'' is applied to what occurs without any known cause, and in opposition to what has been [[foreseen]]; as, a ''fortuitous'' [[concourse]] of atoms. We call a thing ''contingent'' when it is such that, considered in itself, it may or may not happen, but is dependent for its existence on something else; as, the time of my coming will be ''contingent'' on [[intelligence]] yet to be received.
