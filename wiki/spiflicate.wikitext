'''Spiflicate'''

Spiflicate is a word that is used by some parents, grand parents, in a kindly way to their children when fooling with them. This is known here in NZ as well as the U.K.

Note:- My grand daughter actually thought of this word when the family was wondering what word they would use for my car registration they were giving for one of my birthdays. (SPFLK8)
