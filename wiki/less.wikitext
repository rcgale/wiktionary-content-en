====Usage note====
<!-- Changes made here should be reflected in the "Usage note" for FEWER -->
*'''Less''' is correctly used with:
*:Uncountable nouns, such as ''water'', ''time'' or ''patience'', as in '''She has less patience than he does.'''
*:Plural nouns that measure distance, time or amount, as in '''He had to wait less than ten minutes.''' and '''This coat cost less than ten dollars.'''
*With plural nouns, the correct word is [[fewer]]. Some grammatical prescriptivists consider use of ''less'' with plural nouns to be incorrect, although this usage enjoys a considerable amount of use. For example, many writers would find little objectionable about "less than 15 kilometers", "an price of less than $5000", or "a statement in 25 words or less".
*The important difference between [[less]] and [[fewer]] is that ''less'' refers to an <u>amount</u> (an uncountable substance, or something that need not be counted in integers like 1, 2, 3, etc.) and ''fewer'' refers to a <u>number or quantity</u> (something that can only be counted as an integer).  Example: "10 or ''fewer'' items" (this refers to a <U>number</u> of items), and "My sister weighs 10 ''less'' pounds than I do" (weight is an <u>amount</u>, not a number; you can have non-integer amounts of weight, like 1/2 pound or 3/4 pounds, etc.)
