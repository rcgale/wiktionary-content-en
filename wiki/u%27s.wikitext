====Usage Note====
*Neither the use nor the spelling of this word is formally accepted. The second person pronoun [[you]] is preferred.
*While using an apostrophe before the -'''s''' of the plural is considered incorrect, it is used here to distinguish '''u's''' from the first person plural pronoun, '''[[us]]'''.
