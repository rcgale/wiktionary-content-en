==Half-Life 2 Modification==
'''Project Hull-Breach'''

[[Hull breach]] is the name of a Half-Life 2 modification forthcoming some time this year (2005). Project HullBreach is a massive modification project aiming to create a futuristic total conversion the Halflife 2 engine from Valve Software - a unique approach to development, Hull Breach let the public participate in the design of the game which provided a great insight into what gamers did and didn't want. Our team is comprised of amateurs and professionals alike with a few famous names dotted around our core team.


===Features===

*'''Character persistence''' on a small scale, releasing community management code so administrators or companies can (optionally) allow account creation, persistence, skill / tech trees and more. These community sites will be given the option to link in with the main Hullbreach site allowing us to manage leagues, monitor game play, bugtrack and plenty more.
  
*'''Gravity variations''' within a single map allowing you to leave the artificial gravity of ships / space stations.
    
*A unique almost aircraft style visor based Heads up display ('''HUD''') with upgrades
    
*'''Open visor vs. closed visor game play'''. Players'  '''HUD''' (including aiming reticle) are displayed on the players visor. A large tactical element within the Halflife Engine is the use of sound. Within an environment with breathable atmosphere the players will be able to open and close their visor at will. With the visor closed sound will be muffled however you will have a reticle and additional information displayed. Opening the visor will remove your reticle and hud information (apart from vital information displayed on the rim of the helmet) but give the player the advantage of superior audio capabilities.
    
*To combat the blue tack on screen type players we will implement a 'loose' aim to the guns a little like golden eye on the Nintendo 64. '''Iron sights''' for most weapons will also be used.
    
*A respawn system whereby dead players respawn as '''Covert Recon Bot''' (a little like the spiders from minority report), when all living players on a team are dead then the opposition will win regardless of the bots. Using the new source screen within a screen tech we will be allowing living players to view video feed from Recon players. They will also be allowed to interact with map technology (interfacing with consoles and terminals).
    
*'''Territory style''' is the preferred choice of map progression (along with standard map rotations as an option) whereby teams battle over a admin customisable galaxy map and attempt to take every location to win the war - holding key locations will provide access to certain powerups and weapons.
