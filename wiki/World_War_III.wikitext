The term '''World War III''' has been equated with the [[Cold War]] by scholar Norman Podhoretz among others, as a commentary on the global impact of the latter. However, the association of the two terms has lost currency since the end of the Cold War.

Some Biblical scholars have tied the term to prophecies in Chapters 38 and 39 of the Book of [[Ezekiel]] in the OT, and to Armageddon in the NT [[Book of Revelation]]. 

Based on his interpretation of astrologer [[Nostradamus]], author David S. Montaigne predicted World War III would start in 2002. He offers this propecy in his unambiguously tilted book, ''Nostradamus: World War III 2002''. Although Nostradamus never specifically named the year in which the world war would begin, Montaigne cited the following quatrain as evidence: 

From brick to marble, the walls will be converted,
Seven and fifty peaceful years:
Joy to mankind, the aqueduct renewed,
Health, abundant fruits, joy and honey-making times.
- Quatrain 10:89
