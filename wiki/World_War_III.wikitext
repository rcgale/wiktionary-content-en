The term '''World War III'' has been equated with the [[Cold War]] by scholar Norman Podhoretz among others, as a commentary on its global impact. However, the the association has lost some currency since the end of the Cold War.

Some Biblical scholars have tied the term to prophecies in Chapters 38 and 39 of the Book of [[Ezekiel]] in the OT, and to the use of Armageddon in the NT [[Book of Revelations]].
