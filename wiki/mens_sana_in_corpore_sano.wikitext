'''Mens sana in corpore sano''' is a famous quotation by '''[[Decimus Iunius Iuvenalis]]'''. 

The loosely-translated meaning in English for the phrase is "a healthy mind in a healthy body".

The phrase is taken from a longer sentence '''orandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano''' which may be translated:  "you should pray that there be a healthy mind in a healthy body".
