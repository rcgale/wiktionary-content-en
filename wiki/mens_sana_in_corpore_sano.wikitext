'''Mens sana in corpore sano''' is a famous quotation by '''[[Decimus Iunius Iuvenalis]]'''. 

The losely translated meaning in english for the phrase is '''only in a sane body there could be a sane mind'''.

However, it is said that the phrase true meaning is not as such, because the phrase is taken from a longer sentence '''orandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano''' which lexically means '''you have to pray for a sane mind in a healthy body'''.
