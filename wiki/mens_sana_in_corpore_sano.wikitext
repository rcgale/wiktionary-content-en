'''Mens sana in corpore sano''' is a famous quotation by '''[[Decimus Iunius Iuvenalis]]'''. 

The loosely-translated meaning in English for the phrase is "a healthy mind in a healthy body".

The phrase is taken from a longer sentence '''orandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano''' suggesting the interpretation, "you have to pray for a sane mind in a healthy body".
