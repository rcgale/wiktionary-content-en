'''[[French]] [[horn]]'''
{{wikipedia}}
#{{music}} A [[coiled]] [[brass]] [[instrument]] derived from the European hunting horn.  It originally had no valves and was made twice as long as a trumpet of similar tonal range so that more overtones could be employed.  The right hand was inserted into the bell to "[[bend]]" the [[pitch]] and match the tone needed.  A modern French horn has [[valves]] and is often made as two horns in one with different [[tonal]] [[ranges]] (a "double" horn).  The hand is still used for fine tuning and to produce a special muted sound (a hand "stop").
