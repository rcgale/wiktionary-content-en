Spam -n- 1) (internet slang) Most commonly, unsolicited [[email]] advertising a product or service. Generally dispensed in mass mailings of emails to hundreds or thousands of adresses. 2) A luncheon "meat" produced by Hormel foods. (archaic)

Similar to junk faxes and calls from telemarketers, spam represents a new paradigm for advertisers who can now reach 'potential customers' on their own time, as opposed to the more passive advertising of TV commercials, product placements, and billboards.

The general concensus among email users is that companies who advertise through spam are wretched hives of scum and villainy. However, the follow up rate of spam ads is just high enough to outweigh the cost of a mass mailing, making the technique profitable and ensuring that spam will be with us for some time to come.
