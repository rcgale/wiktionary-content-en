====Usage Note====
Square dancing is called in English everywhere except in parts of French Canada.  This square dance move is one of the oldest, and as a term which came over from another language, over the years it has been spelled many ways in English, including '''Dos a Dos''', '''Dosado''', '''Do-Sa-Do''', '''Dosido''', and '''Do-Si-Do'''.  Note that none of these is quite the same as the original French phrase.
