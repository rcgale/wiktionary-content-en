===[[noun]]===
A special [[mortgage]] where the [[borrower]] only pays back the [[interest]] charged by the [[lender]]. Therefore the outstanding balance does not decrease as it does with a standard loan.

At the sime time, the borrower pays an additional sum ([[premium]]) into an [[endowment policy]]. When the endowment policy matures the lump sum received from it is used to reduce the mortgage balance.

The use of reserves to smooth out fund profits by the [[assurer]], cause the growth rates of endowment policies (from the assured's perspective) to be out of synch with the rest of the economy. Usually after a short, sharp stock market correction, the borrowing rates are lower than the growth rates earned on endowment policies. It then makes sense for a borrower to take out an endowment-linked mortgage.

However, if the economy improves, interest rates on borrowings will rise, while the growth rates on endowments may come down when the assurers' acturaries realise that their reserves are declining. At such a time it is vital that borrowers be able to afford to pay more into their mortgages to reduce their outstanding loan balances.

Over the longer term (25 to 30 years) these rates tend to balance out and a typical borrower should be about 5% better off for having an endowment-linked mortgage over a standard one. However the risks are much higher, and these risks are rarely explained to borrowers.
