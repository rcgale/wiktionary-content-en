Pebcak is an abbreviation used in jest by technical support helpdesk staff when diagnosing a problem on a user's computer to be due to the incompetence of the user themselves.  The comment in it's entirety reads:

* Problem Exists Between Chair and Keyboard

Variations include Pebkac, Pibcak and Pibkac in which the words keyboard and chair are transposed and the letter I stands for the word "is".
