As I learned today from my friend Mr. Ball, "moving the yardsticks" is a common expression used in political and corporate venues such as speeches, to express proactive actions.  Originally it was an american football term with the underlying meaning of "get a first down, and the yardsticks will move".  In american football the yardsticks represented a 10 yard stretch which had to be reached in order to achieve a first down.  BTW, there are 4 downs in american football as opposed to Canadian football having 3.
