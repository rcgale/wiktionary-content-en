== English ==
A [[Jewish]] annual feast, involving a meal with wine and unleavened bread, recalling the [[exodus]] and deliverance of the Jewish people from
the land of Egypt through Moses. Seder is also called [[Passover]] due to the "passing over" by the [[angel]] of death 
and sparing the lives of the [[first born]] children and animals. By extension Passover also refers to the eight days of the feast.

A Seder meal by Jesus Christ and his [[disciple]]s is the original source of the [[Christian]] ceremony alternately called [[Communion]], [[Mass]], or the [[Eucharist]].
