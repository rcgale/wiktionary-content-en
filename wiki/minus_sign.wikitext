===Noun===
'''minus sign''' (''plural'' '''minus signs''')

#{{mathematics}} The symbol − or - used in [[mathematics]] to denote the [[operation]] of [[subtraction]] and to indicate that a number is [[negative]].

====Notes====
*Often in typography (and always in computer programming), the [[hyphen]] (-) is used instead of the minus sign (−); in many fonts, the symbols are barely distinguishable or not at all (although the difference is clear in Times Roman).  Careful typographers use the minus sign instead of the hyphen.

====Translations====
*Estonian: [[miinusmärk]]
*Finnish: [[miinusmerkki]]
*French: [[signe moins]] ''m''
*Italian: [[segno meno]] ''m''
*Swedish: [[minustecken]] ''n'', [[minus]] ''n''

<!-- Please note the following when editing this page:

* A minus sign is a mathematical symbol, not a punctuation mark
* Hyphens and dashes are not the same as minus signs (nor as each other)
* Translations should therefore be for the mathematical symbol only
