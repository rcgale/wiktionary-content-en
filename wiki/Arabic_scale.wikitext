The arabic scale is arrived at by: 
Raising the seventh of the [[Jewish scale]]
Raising the seventh and third of the Phrygian Scale
Lowering the sixth and second of a [[major scale]]

Series of intervals:
H -3 H W H -3 H

H = Half step
W = Whole Step
-3 = Minor third or 3 Half steps

As you can see, the Arabic scale is symmetrical and palindromic.  It's also fun.
