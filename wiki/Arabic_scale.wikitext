In [[music]], the '''[[Arabic]] scale''' is arrived at by either: 
*Raising the seventh of the [[Jewish scale]]
*Raising the seventh and third of the [[Phrygian mode]]
*Lowering the sixth and second of a [[major scale]]

The sequence of [[step]]s comprising the Arabic scale is:
*[[minor second|half]] &ndash; [[minor third|augmented]] &ndash; half &ndash; [[major second|whole]] &ndash; half &ndash; [[minor third|augmented]] &ndash; whole

This scale is [[symmetrical]].
