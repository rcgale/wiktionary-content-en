In [[music]], the '''[[Arabic]] scale''' is arrived at by either: 
*Raising the seventh of the [[Jewish scale]]
*Raising the seventh and third of the [[Phrygian scale]]
*Lowering the sixth and second of a [[major scale]]

Series of intervals:
:H -3 H W H -3 H

:H = Half step
:W = Whole step
:-3 = Minor third or 3 Half steps

As you can see, the Arabic scale is [[symmetrical]].
