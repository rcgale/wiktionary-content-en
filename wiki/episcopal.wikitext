The term ''Episcopal'' should be used when referring to the Episcopal church, as in ''There was a small Episcopal church at the end of the lane,'' or ''He had been an Episcopal priest for twenty years,'' but one often hears ''*Episcopalian'' instead.

Similarly, ''Episcopalian'' refers to an individual member of the church, but one may hear ''*Episcopal'' instead.
