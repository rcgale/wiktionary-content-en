Used extensively in industry, appliances, and vehicles. Manufactureres of low cost microcontrollers include Atmel, Microchip, Motorola, TI, Philips, Dallas, and Hitachi.

A microcontroller is programmed before or after insertion into the circuit board with a [[computer program]] that governs its behaviour.

A modern microcontroller will typically have:
* 8 to 40 pin package
* 8 or 16 bit CPU executing at 0.2 to 20 MIPS
* 0.5kB to 128kB [[FLASH]] or [[EPROM]] program memory
* 64 to 4096 bytes of RAM
* Clock generator
* Serial IO devices
* Parallel digital IO ports
* Timers and counters
* A [[watchdog timer]] (or computer operating properly (COP) circuit)
* [[Interupt controller]]

A microcontroller may also have:
* 1 to 16 channels of 8 to 12 bit analog to digital converter (ADC) inputs
* [[Pulse width modulation]] (PWM) outputs
* 64 to 4096 bytes [[EEPROM]]
* [[In circuit programming]] port
