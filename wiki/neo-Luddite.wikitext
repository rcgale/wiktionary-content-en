===Noun===

1. One who eschews new technologies in favour of less recent technologies, often with a romantic view of the cumbersome nature inherent in less recent technologies.

Typically applied to consumer technologies with large discontinuous jumps in complexity, i.e. type-writer to wordprocessor, record player to mp3 player. Often employed due to practicle reasons e.g. not wanting to replace ones entire record collection because prefered player is now considered out of vogue.

2. Group of people with belief that technology represents agent of negative change, with strong ties to the left-wing, anti-globalisation movementys of the late C20th & early C21st.
