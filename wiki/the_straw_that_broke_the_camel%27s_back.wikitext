The idiom '''the straw that broke the camel's back''' From a proverb about loading up a camel beyond its capacity to move.  This is a reference to any process by which cataclysmic failure (a broken back) is achieved by a seemingly inconsequential addition (a single straw).  This also gives rise to the phrase "the last straw."
One of the earliest usages of this phrase was in Charles Dickens' Dombey and Son where he says "As the last straw breaks the laden camel's back", meaning that there is a limit to everyone's endurance, or everyone has his breaking point. Dickens was writing in the nineteenth century and he may have received his inspiration from an earlier proverb, recorded by Thomas Fuller in his 'Gnomologia' as 'Tis the last feather that breaks the horse's back.'
