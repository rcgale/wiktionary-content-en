From a proverb about loading up a camel beyond its capacity to move.  This is a reference to any process by which cataclysmic failure (a broken back) is achieved by a seemingly inconsequential addition (a single straw).  This also gives rise to the phrase "the last straw."

Ironically it's not the '''last straw''' that "broke the camel's back" but rather the aggregate of all of them.
