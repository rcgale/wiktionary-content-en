The idiom '''the straw that broke the camel's back''' From a proverb about loading up a camel beyond its capacity to move.  This is a reference to any process by which cataclysmic failure (a broken back) is achieved by a seemingly inconsequential addition (a single straw).  This also gives rise to the phrase "the last straw."
