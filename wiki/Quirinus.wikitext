'''Quirinus'''<br>
# An old [[Roman deity]] whose origin is uncertain. He was worshipped by the [[Sabines]]. They had a fortified settlement near [[Rome]], the Quirinal, which was named after their god. Later, when Rome expanded, this settlement was absorbed by the city, and Quirinus became, together with Jupiter and Mars, the god of the state. The [[Quirinalis]], one of the [[hills of Rome]], was named after him. He was usually depicted as a bearded man who wears clothing that is part clerical and part military. His sacred plant is the myrtle. His festival, the Quirinalia, was celebrated on February 17. 
#[[Romulus]] was also identified with Quirinus, especially in the late-Roman era (Virgil I, 292). The accepted myth is that Quirinus is the deified form of [[Romulus]].
