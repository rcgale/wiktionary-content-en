This article is about the origins and meaning of the phrase. '''''[[Lord of the Flies]]''''' is the title of a novel by [[William Golding]].
----
'''Lord of the Flies''' is the English-language translation of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''Baal-zevuv'', which in turn is a deliberate corruption of the name of the [[Semitic]] god [[Beelzebub]]. Ancient [[Israelites]] changed the meaning of Beelzebub to disparage the pagan god, positioning Beelzebub as lesser than [[Yahweh]], and later, as a false [[idol]]. [[Christian]] references to Beelzebub used the same derivation to describe [[Satan]].

In a less literal sense, to be 'lord of the flies' is to rule over a worthless kingdom; Golding's novel presents a [[microcosm]] in which children fight and die to promulgate and dominate a broken, meaningless society.
