'''Lord of the Flies''' is the English-language translation of the [[Hebrew]] word ''Baal-zevuv'', which in turn is a deliberate corrption of the name of the [[Semitic]] god [[Beelzebub]]. It is said that the ancient [[Israelites]] changed the meaning of Beelzebub to disparage the pagan god. Later [[Christian]] references to Beelzebub also use this same meaning.

''[[Lord of the Flies (novel)|Lord of the Flies]]'' is also the title of a novel by [[William Golding]].
