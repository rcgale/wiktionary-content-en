'''Lord of the Flies''' is the English-language translation of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''Baal-zevuv'', which in turn is a deliberate corrption of the name of the [[Semitic]] god [[Beelzebub]]. Ancient [[Israelites]] changed the meaning of Beelzebub to disparage the pagan god, positioning Beelzebub as lesser than [[Yahweh]], and later, as a false [[idol]]. [[Christian]] references to Beelzebub used the same derivation to describe [[Satan]].

''[[Lord of the Flies (novel)|Lord of the Flies]]'' is also the title of a novel by [[William Golding]].
