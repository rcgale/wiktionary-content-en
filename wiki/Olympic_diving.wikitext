Olympic high divers wear tight fitted clothing so that their clothes are not flying every were and they make as little of a splash  as possible.  The diving boards that they use are very high up, not bouncey and made of concrete so that when the divers go to dive they are not jiggling all over the place.  The people who train the divers are called diving coaches. There are many places to train.  Some of the places have pools with high dives and the normal spring board.  These places may also have things like pits filled with foam blocks and trampolines.  Being a diver takes a long time and yearound training but in the end it is all worth it according to the olympic high divers.
