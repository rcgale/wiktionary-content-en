'''hypothesis''' (Plural: [[hypotheses]])

A hypothesis is an unproved proposition to explain a certain fact or observation. A working hypothesis is a scientist's best estimation, based on scientific knowledge and assumptions, of the results of an experiment. One reason that hypotheses are so important is that in order to evaluate the significance of research data, scientists need something to compare it to. A hypothesis typically provides the key point of comparison for experimental data, leading to two crucial questions that must be addressed in the lab report: did you find what you expected to find? why or why not? The point of an experiment is to test the hypothesis. The null hypothesis for any experiment is that the results were due to random chance alone. Statistical tests cannot evaluate working hypotheses directly; they can only provide the basis for accepting or rejecting the cooresponding null hypothesis.
