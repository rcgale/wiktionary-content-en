== [[noun]] ==
# ''colloq.'' a group of two or more words which include a [[subject]] and any necessary [[predicate]] (the predicate also includes a [[verb]], [[conjunction]], or a [[preposition]] to begin the clause, however this clause is not considered a sentence for colloquial purposes.
#In formal usage, if a sentence contains a named [[subject]] and a [[predicate]], it is considered an ''independent clause''. Some grammarians prefer the term ''independent clause'' or [[simple sentence]] as opposed to [[sentence]].

==Example of a grammatical dependent clause.==
(e.g. ''When it got dark, they went back into the house'', "''When'' it got dark" is the clause within the complete sentence) The conjuction ''when'' begins the main clause (when it got dark, .." ; however, the [[pronoun]] ''it'' lacks a declared subject causing the reader to expect a [[subordinate clause]] to complete the idea.

# a separate part of a contract, a will or another legal document.
