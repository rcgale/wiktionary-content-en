==English==
===Etymology===

This [[phrase]] developed in 19th century United States, at [[carnival]]s.  Often, winners of games of strength received a [[cigar]] as a prize.  If a player failed to win, the carnival worker would tell him or her "Close, but no cigar".  Over time, this phrase came to represent a broader exclamation of [[encouragement]].

===Proverb===
'''Close, but no cigar'''
#you almost won, and with a little more effort a win is in your grasp; said to a person in order to encourage them to attempt a [[game]] or similar activity again.
