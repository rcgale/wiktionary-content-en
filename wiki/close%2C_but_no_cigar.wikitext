'''''Close, but no cigar''''' is an [[adage]] that is said to a person in order to commend them for attempting a [[game]] or similar activity.

==Etymology==

This [[phrase]] developed in [[19th century]] [[United States|America]], at [[carnival]]s.  Often, winners of games of strength received a [[cigar]] as a prize.  If a player failed to win, the carnival worker would tell him or her "Close, but no cigar".  Over time, this phrase came to represent a broader exclamation of [[encouragement]].
