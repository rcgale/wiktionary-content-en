===[[pronoun]]===
The objective case of [[who]]. 

'''Usage note''': In both written and spoken language, ''who'' is often used in place of ''whom'', even as an object, although such usage is considered gramatically incorrect by some. The use of ''whom'' is chacteristic of a formal style, and is often considered stilted in informal conversation.
