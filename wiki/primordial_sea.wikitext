The '''primordial sea''', or '''primordial ocean''', is a term applied collectively to the [[ocean|oceans]] of the [[earth]] at a time early in its history. The term generally implies either the time before or during the development of [[Metazoa|multi-cellular life forms]] (i.e., during the [[Precambrian]]), or alternatively before the development of the first land-based life forms (i.e. during the early [[Paleozoic]]).

The term '''primordial ooze''' is often invoked to imply the primordial sea in a more metaphorical or poetic sense.  The '''primordial soup''' refers to a particular set of models of the [[origin of life]], but may also be used in a metaphorical sense.
