The '''primordial sea''', or '''primordial ocean''', is a term applied collectively to the [[ocean|oceans]] of the [[earth]] at a time early in its history, generally before the development of large multi-cellular life forms, or alternatetively before the development of land-based ancestors of [[mammal|mammals]].

The terms ''primordial ooze'' and ''primordial soup'' are often invoked to imply the primordial sea in a more metaphorical or poetic sense.

In literature and theology, the term is generally taken to be synonomous with the waters of [[creation]], as described in [[Genesis]].
