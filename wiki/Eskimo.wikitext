The word Eskimo is not an Eskimo word. It means "eaters of raw meat"  and was used by the Algonquin Indians of eastern Canada for these hardy  neighbors who wore animal-skin clothing and were adept hunters. The name  became commonly employed by European explorers and now is generally  used, even by Eskimo. Their own term for themselves is Inuit (the Yupik  variant is Yuit), which means the "real people."
