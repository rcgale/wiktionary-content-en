* Sandra E. Eddy, <cite>HTML in Plain English</cite>, 1997, ISBN 1-55828-511, page 23, "Except for the [[title]], the contents of the [[HEAD]] section do not appear on the [[Web page]] when it's [[loaded]]. Some [[detail-oriented]] people (a much friendlier term than [[quibbler]] or [[hairsplitter]]) might argue that the title is not actually on the [[page]]; it's above the page in the [[title bar]]. Whatever."
