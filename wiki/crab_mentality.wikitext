'''Crab mentality''' describes a way of thinking best described by the phrase "if I can't have it, neither can you."  The metaphor refers to a  pot of crabs in which one tries to escape over the side, but is relentlessly pulled down by the others in the pot.

It is most often used to describe [[Filipino]]s.
