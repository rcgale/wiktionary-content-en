#{{chemistry}} a form or [[isomerism]] in which [[atom]]s are [[arranged]] [[differently]] about a [[chiral]] [[centre]] (or centre of [[asymmetry]]); they [[exhibit]] [[optical activity]]; in a [[molecule]] with a [[single]] chiral centre the two isomers ([[enantiomer]]s) are [[mirror image]]s of each other; in a molecule with [[multiple]] chiral centres the isomers ([[diastereoisomer]]s) are not normally mirror images
