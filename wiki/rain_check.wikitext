A '''raincheck''' is an informal agreement by a [[merchant]] to a [[customer]] to provide an item he has run out of at a later time at a specific price. This is particularly helpful to the customer if a special [[sale]] was going on. The term might have originated in the era of open-air [[market]]s where the occurrence of significant [[rain]] usually required a vendor to pack up his goods and leave.
