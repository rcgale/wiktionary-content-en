A '''raincheck''' is an informal agreement by a [[merchant]] to a [[customer]] to provide an item he has run out of at a later time at a specific price.  This is particularly helpful to the customer if a special [[sale]] was going on.  The term might have originated in the era of open-air [[market]]s where the occurrence of significant [[rain]] usually required a vendor to pack up his goods and leave.

Others dispute that the origin of a raincheck comes from old American baseball stadiums which had no roof and gave out raincheck slips which allowed the ticket holders to watch the game on a later date. 

Today the expressions is used in social interactions. "I'll get a raincheck on that" is a polite way to turn down an invitation to a party, a date or a social get-together.
