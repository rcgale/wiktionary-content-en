<!--From the discussion page for "John Kerry" in Wikipedia:
        * I've seen it both ways but lower case is more common than capitalized.
        * I don't think it's a trademark but I'm not sure. (At http://www.state.nj.us/health/eoh/rtkweb/2142.pdf (last page), "Bacitracin" is given as the chemical name. There are a bunch of other names, possibly trademarks.)
        * The dispute here was about whether it's an antibiotic or an antiseptic, and the former description seems far more common, including in the Wiktionary definition.
        * Wikipedia doesn't want to duplicate Wiktionary. Therefore, articles are routinely deleted on grounds of "dicdef," i.e., if the supposed Wikipedia article is nothing more than a dictionary definition, dump it. There is no Wikipedia article on bacitracin and quite possibly never will be.

    Now, for our purposes, maybe the link to Wiktionary doesn't really add anything. We could un-link it and just add the parenthetical "(an antibiotic)" after the term. JamesMLane 09:47, 6 Aug 2004 (UTC)
