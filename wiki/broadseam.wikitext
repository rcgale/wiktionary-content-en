'''Broadseam''' is a term of art for shaping the panels or pieces of fabric in a [[sail]].  The term derives from broadening the overlap (seam) between parallel sided panels near the edges of the sail, effectively making the panels wider (and therefore the sail deeper) toward the center of the sail.
