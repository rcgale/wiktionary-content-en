#In feudal [[Japan]], a samurai was a soldier of noble birth who followed the code of [[bushido]] and served a [[daimyo]].  They usually wielded a [[katana]] in battle.  The samurai were technically disbanded in the Meiji Revolution, but the military use of bushido survived until the end of World War II.
