===Etymology===
Middle English [[þorn]] and Old English [[þorn]], from common Germanic ''*thurn(u)-'', from [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*(s)ter-n-'' "sharp stalk or thorn", possibly derived from ''*ster-'' "stiff".  Near cognates include German [[Dorn]] and Gothic [[𐌸𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌽𐌿𐍃]] (þaurnus).  Further cognates include [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[трънъ]] (trŭnŭ) "thorn" and Sanskrit [[तृण]] (tṛṇa) "grass".
