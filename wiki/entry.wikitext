An '''entry''' (also known as a '''foyer''') is a small [[room]] just inside the front door, often an access to a stairway, as well as providing a means to enter other rooms, such as the [[living room]], [[study (room)|den]], or [[kitchen]].
In the north of England, it was also used as a term for the passageway set into a terrace of houses to allow access through to the back.
