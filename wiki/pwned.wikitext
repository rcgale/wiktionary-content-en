=== Etymology ===
Ambiguous origin; variant of "owned" possibly because "p" is one beyond "o" ergo "pwned" is a higher degree of "owned," also possibly simply a typo which gained popularity.  (see [[w:pwn|pwn]])

This originated in an online game called Warcraft, where a map designer misspelled "owned." When the computer beat a player, it was supposed to say, so-and-so "has been owned."

Instead, it said, so-and-so "has been pwned."

=== Transitive Verb ===
'''pwned'''
# (slang) to be [[defeated]] in an extremely [[humiliating]] way
#: ''I completely '''pwned''' my friend in the game last night''
