'''boyfriend''' (''plural'' '''boyfriends''')

#A [[male]] partner in a non-marital romantic relationship.

In contrast to its female equivalent, girlfriend, which is often used to describe a woman's close female friends, the term is rarely used in reference to non-romantic relationships. ''Boyfriend'' is a relatively modern term, and in the past has had implications of an illicit relationship (as sexual and romantic relationships outside marriage were generally frowned upon). It is now a generally accepted term and has no negative implications. 

Use of ''boyfriend'' generally implies that the male is a [[boy]] or a [[young]] [[man]].  An [[old]]er man in a non-marital [[relationship]] and sometimes even a young man in a long-term relationship is more often described as a [[significant other]] or [[partner]].
