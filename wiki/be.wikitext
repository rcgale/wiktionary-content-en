===Verb===
====Intransitive Verb====
'''to be'''
<!-- I've commented this next out because it's really no different from any other verb.  You use "going ''infinitive''" or "will ''stem of infinitive''" for future, present for present, past or past participle for past.  In fact, the statement given is misleading: ''is'', ''am'' and ''are'' are all present tense, ''was'' and ''were'' are both past, and there may be other quibbles. -->
<!-- '''Be''' is ordinarily used in the sense of a [[future]] event or transaction that will or has not yet taken place, while "''[[is]]''" is typically used for something that is happening now or otherwise used in the [[present tense]], and "''[[was]]''" or ''"[[been]]"'' is used for an event that did happen or is referenced in the [[past tense]].  -->

# To occupy a place <!-- cf. Spanish estar vs. ser -->
#:''The cat is in the bag, it will still be in the bag tomorrow.''
# To occur, to take place
#: ''When and where is the test?  It will be tomorrow, in room 5.''
