Fringer (frinj-er): A person on the fringe of a crowd. First used by Leslie A Turvey on March 25, 2001, in an article titled “Blessed Are They Which Are Persecuted.”
   He wrote, “In any gathering there are always those at the fringe
 of the crowd where they can creep away when the message goes against
 their liking. You might call them fringers.”
