Negress – [pronounced Neg' - ress as in dress]
in simplest terms a Negress is a female Negro.
In non-black societies its connotation carries an exoticism or mysticism associated with a dark skinned female of African decent.  
In Africa however it is usually tantamount to a second class citizen.  Africans usually don’t recognize that females are treated as second class citizens in local settings because it is the norm. The Negress that the African Negro takes on as a spouse that belongs to their own tribe is arranged through negotiations with her family. If a bride is to be taken from a different tribe it is negotiated usually with a bride price through other tribal authority.
With age the Negress can become a person with some recognition resembling a status since most Africans identifies all female of age with their own mother.  In tribal societies the extended family is the norm so that all relatives or members of the same tribe can be referred to as mothers or fathers.  The term Negress is somewhat lost in these situations with be the replacement of parental endearment of Mother, Grandmother or Great Mother.
