In [[radio]] communications, the '''reverse link''' (sometimes called a ''return link'') is the link from a mobile user to a fixed base station.

If the link includes a [[communication satellite|communications relay satellite]], the reverse link will consist of both an [[uplink]] (mobile station to satellite) and a [[downlink]] (satellite to base station).

See also [[forward link]].
