==== Usage note ====
As is normal in Japanese, the word ''一緒に'' generally refers to the topic, which in a simple statent like 「一緒に行きませんか。」, is going to be the speaker.  Thus, 「一緒に行きませんか。」 can usually be translated to "Won't you go with me?", except where the context dictates otherwise.

==== Construction ====
[someone]'''と'''一緒に ([someone]'''と''' いっしょに)

# together with [someone]
#: ''Note: If the person being referred to is clear from context, then 誰と can be omitted.  When omitted, the person being referred to is usually the speaker or the listener.  Thus 一緒に by itself can, in effect, mean "with me" or "with you".''
