==Intransitive verb== 
To give up the will, courage, or spirit; to be thoroughly disheartened; to lose all courage; to become dispirited or
depressed; to take an unhopeful view.

==Noun== 
Despondency (obsolete).

==Synonym==
'''''[[Despair]]''''' implies a total loss of hope, which ''despond'' does not, at least in every case. Nevertheless, ''[[despondency]]'' is often more lasting than
''despair'', or than ''[[desperation]]'', which impels to violent
action.
