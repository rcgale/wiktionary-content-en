*Use '''i.e.''' to explain or clarify a statement by either (exhaustively) listing  options or by rephrasing the previous statement.  
*Always follow '''i.e.''' by a [[comma]] when used in it's function as a clarifier. 
*When used in a sentence, '''i.e.''' should be used parenthetically ('''i.e.''', embraced in parentheses).
*Opinion is mixed about whether this abbreviations should be italicized, or whether there should be a separating non-breaking space as in '''i.&nbsp;e.'''.
