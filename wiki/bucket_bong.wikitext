===Noun===
#A form of smoking [[marijuana]]. First, a large bottle with the bottom removed is fitted with a [[conepiece]] at the lid. The marijuana in the conepiece is lit while the bottle is almost fully submerged in a bucket of water. While the marijuana is being burnt the bottle is raised, which causes a vacuum inside the bottle, forcing the smoke from the marijuana into the bottle, in a pressurised form. The conepiece is then removed and the participant places his/her mouth on the lid of the bottle and forcibly pushes it back down into the water, which forces the pressurised smoke into the lungs at a rapid speed.
