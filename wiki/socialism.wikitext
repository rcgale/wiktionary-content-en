===Noun===
'''socialism''' ([[uncountable]])

#The political philosophy (or group of political philosophies) that supports a high degree of social and economic equality, coupled with collective decision-making and some degree of collective or public ownership over productive capital and natural resources. The main branches of socialism are the following:
##[[Social democracy]] - a moderate political philosophy that aims to achieve socialistic goals within capitalist society (e.g. by heavily taxing the rich to help the poor).
##[[Marxism]] - a revolutionary political philosophy that aims to achieve socialistic goals by first capturing state power (a phase known as "socialism" or "dictatorship of the proletariat") and then progressing to a fully communist society in which the state is no longer required (the same society as advocated by anarchists).
##[[Libertarian socialism]] or [[anarchism]] - a revolutionary political philosophy that aims to achieve socialistic goals by encouraging people to directly seize the means of production and create a free and equal society without a state.
#Any society advocated by socialists in line with their beliefs.
#Specifically in Marxism, the intermediate phase of social development that comes after capitalism but before full communism. This is a strategy whereby the government has control of all key resource-producing industries and manages most aspects of the market. It is in stark opposition to [[capitalism]].
