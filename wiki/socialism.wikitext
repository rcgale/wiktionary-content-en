#A strategy of [[government]] where the government has control of many key resource-producing industries and manages many aspects of the market.  It is in stark opposition to the ''[[laissez faire]]'' attitude of [[capitalism]], but is often observed as a balancing agent to [[monopoly|monopolies]] and other [[free enterprise]] nightmares.
