A "German" cussword which literally means pig-dog.  This word was invented for American World War II movies and is not used in German. Germans would use simply "Schwein" (i.e pig). A similar word exists in German "Schweinehund" (usually used in the phrase "innerer Schweinehund") with a meaning similar to compunction, fear, or scruple.
