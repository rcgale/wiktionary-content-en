==English==
===Etymology===
''c'', the symbol used in physics for the speed of light, [[decay]]

===Noun===
'''''c''-decay''' (''[[uncountable]]'')

#A discredited [[theory]] proposed by [[creationist]]s in order to support the belief that the [[universe]] is a few thousand years old that claims that the [[speed of light]] has decreased over time, meaning that objects millions of [[light year]]s away are visible today (whereas a constant speed of light would imply that the universe is millions of years old and so contradict this belief).
