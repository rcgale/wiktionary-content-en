==Assembly Language==

'''Proper noun''', ''Computer Terminology''

'''Assembly Language''' is a low-level [[programming language]] used mostly in writing [[operating system]]s, [[hardware]] [[drivers]], and [[video games]]. Because Assembly Language allows direct control of hardware devices, it is possible to write smaller and faster code for such applications than it would be in a high-level language. However, Assembly Language does not incorporate safeguards to prevent bad instructions from damaging the computer, so care must be used by the [[programmer]] to ensure that all possible error conditions are properly handled.
