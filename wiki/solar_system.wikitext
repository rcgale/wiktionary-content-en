'''[[solar]] [[system]]''' (''plural'' '''solar systems''')

#The collection of [[heavenly bodies]] including one or more [[star]]s, and the [[planet]]s, [[moon]]s, [[asteroid]]s, and [[comet]]s which are in [[orbit]] around the star or stars due to the [[gravitational field]](s) of the star or stars; our solar system consists of the [[Sun]], the nine discovered planets, their moons, and the various orbiting asteroids and comets.

====Usage note====
*Usually used specifically to refer to our own solar system, in which case it is used with ''the'' and often capitalised (as '''the Solar System''').  Other solar systems are then known as [[star system]] to distinguish them from the Sun's solar system.
