'''solar system'''
#The collection of [[heavenly bodies]] including one or more [[star]]s, and the [[planet]]s, [[moon]]s, [[asteroid]]s, and [[comet]]s which are held by their [[gravitational fields]].  For example, our own solar system consists of the [[Sun]], the nine discovered planets, their moons, and the various asteroids and comets which orbit the planets and Sun.

Often used specifically to refer to our own solar system.  Other terms include [[star system]] (especially when refering to an [[alien]] solar system).
