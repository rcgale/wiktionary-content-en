'''''Jaungoikoa''''' or '''''Jainko''''' is the {{ll|Basque}} word for "[[God]]".

It is unclear whether ''jainko'' is derived from ''Jaungoikoa'' or the other way round.
It has been suggested that Christian missionaries created "''Jaungoikoa''" as a [[folk etymology]] ("The Lord of above") for ''jainko''.
In modern Basque, the grammatical form would be ''goiko jauna''.
Current usage has "Jaungoikoa" for the [[Christian God]] and "jainko" for generic [[god]]s.

It has been suggested that Basque ''Jainko'' through {{ll|Gascon}} is the origin of the English phrase "By [[Jingo]]!".

The travelogue of the medieval pilgrim [[Aymericus Picaudus]] mentions that the Basque word for "God" was ''[[Urtzi|Urcia]]'', the old word for "sky".

''[[JEL|Jaungoikoa eta Lege-zaharra]]'' ("God and [[Fueros|Old Law]]") is the motto of the Basque nationalistic Christian party [[EAJ-PNV]].
