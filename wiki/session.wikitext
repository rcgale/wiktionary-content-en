# {{computing}} Used in reference to web applications, a session is the sequence of interactions between the server and a user.  A users session can store persistent data between different web pages.  For instance, a person might login to a site on one page, then go on using other pages on the site.  The login step begins a session where the server tracks information about that specific user.  Sessions typically expire after a set time of non-interaction and are removed from the server's memory.
