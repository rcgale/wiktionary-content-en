In [[hacker]] culture, the term '''DayStar''' can be used to refer to the [[Sun]] around which the [[Earth]] orbits. Often, it is used to denounce the existence of the sun, such as when exiting a dimly-lit building. 

Ex: "Arg, the evil DayStar burns my eyes!"

Breaking down the word, one is made to understand that the Sun is, in fact, a [[star]]. This fact illustrates basic knowledge of [[solar system]] mechanics by the user of the term.

As well, the word suggests dissociation with the sun, much the same as using an [[acronym]] in place of full words.
