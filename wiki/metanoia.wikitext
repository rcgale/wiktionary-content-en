===Etymology===
From Greek word μετάνοια, "after/behind  one's mind", it is a compound word of the preposition 'meta' (after, with), and the verb 'noeo' (to perceive, to think, the result of perceiving or observing). 

In this compound word the preposition combines the two meanings of time and change, which may be denoted by 'after' and 'different'; so that the whole compound means: 'to think differently after'. Metanoia is therefore primarily an after-thought, different from the former thought; a change of mind accompanied by regret and change of conduct [http://www.preceptaustin.org/2_peter_39-10.htm].

The word occurs 22 times in the original [[Greek]] version of the [[New Testament]] [http://www.preceptaustin.org/2_peter_39-10.htm], and is usually translated as [[repent]] or [[repentance]].

===Noun===
#"Repentance," as translated by biblical scholars.
#"New mind" or "above mind"
#"A deep spiritual, life altering reversion to God" in the [[Christian]] context
