'''aorist aspect'''

#''(Grammar):'' The '''aorist aspect''' is a feature of the [[verb]] which denotes an action or condition that is completed and singular. In this respect it is similar to the [[perfective aspect]], but the aorist also exists in the [[present tense]], like the [[imperfective aspect]]. An example of the aorist is the verb pair "to listen" and "to hear." "To listen" has a continuous action and thus is '''imperfective'''; "to hear" has the same meaning as "to listen," but it is a singular, momentary, finite action and thus is '''aorist''' in aspect.
