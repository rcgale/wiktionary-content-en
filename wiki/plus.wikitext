===Adjective===
====Pronouniation====
''ply'' or ''plys'''
# [[more]], [[-er]]
#:''Ton voisin est '''plus''' moche que mon frère''
#::''Your neighbour is ugli[[-er|er]] than my brother''
===Conjugation===
====Pronounciation====
''ply''
#  No longer, not any more
#:''Tu '''n''''existe '''plus'''''
#::''You '''no longer''' exist''
====Usage====
Often the difference is hard to tell between '''''ply''''' and '''''plys'''''. But generally, if a sentence has a '''''ne''''' tucked away in it, without a ''pas'' (another negative), the meaning is ''no longer''. However, the French have a tendancy to omit the ''ne''.
