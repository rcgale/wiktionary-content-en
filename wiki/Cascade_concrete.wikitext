'''Cascade Concrete''' is a wet, heavy, and often sticky [[snow]].  Cascade [[concrete]] gets its name because it is characteristic of the  [[w:Cascade Range|Cascades]] of the Northwestern [[w:United States|United States]], in particular the lower-[[elevation]] regions of [[w:Washington State|Washington State]], such as [[w:Snoqualmie Pass|Snoqualmie Pass]].  Cascade concrete makes [[skiing]] and [[snowboarding]] difficult, and requires much more strength to handle than the [[fluffy]] stuff of, say, [[w:Colorado|Colorado]].
