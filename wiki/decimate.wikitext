====Usage Note====

The definition ''reduce by one in ten'' is occasionally cited as "the correct" definition, with ''severely reduce'' considered a "misconception".

Actual usage for the past few centuries has strongly favored the "severely reduce" sense.  The historically accurate sense is rarely if ever attested, except perhaps in historical accounts.  For example, of the 23 occurrences of ''decimate'' in the British National Corpus (http://sara.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/saraWeb?qy=decimate), almost all clearly accord with the modern sense. The only references to the historical sense are two complaints about modern usage and its critics.  Neither of these actually uses the term to mean "reduce by one-tenth".
