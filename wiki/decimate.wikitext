Of the 23 occurrences of ''decimate'' in the [http://sara.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/saraWeb?qy=decimate British National Corpus], almost all clearly accord with the modern sense.  The only references to the original sense (resuce by one in ten) are two complaints about modern usage and its critics.  Interestingly, none of the 23 uses seems to mean ''reduce to one-tenth''.
