===Usage===
The term '''decimate''' has three usages:
#reduce ''by'' one tenth (1/10) - literal (ten reduced to nine)
#reduce ''to'' one tenth (1/10) - misconception (ten reduced to one)
#reduce  by a considerable amount - common use (<i>n</i> reduced to much less than <i>n</i>)

Usage 1 is the correct according to a [[dictionary]] definition. It is explained by the [[Roman]] army practice whereby the leaders punished and motivated the [[legion]]s, after defeats, by killing every tenth (deci-) man. 

Usage 2 is a common misconception of Usage 1, whereby people think that 'decimate' means to reduce ''to'' one tenth.

Usage 3 is the way in which the word exists in common usage amongst most speakers of English who simply use it to mean a drastic reduction.
