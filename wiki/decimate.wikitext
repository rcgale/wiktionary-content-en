===Usage Note===
The definition ''reduce by one in ten'' is occasionally cited as "the correct" definition, with ''severely reduce'' considered a "misconception".  While the second is doubtless based on the re-analysis that ''deci-'' refers to dividing by ten and not to eliminating a tenth, it is nonetheless the current usage, and has been for centuries.  If you use ''decimate'' in the first sense in general writing, expect to be misunderstood.

For example, of the 23 occurrences of ''decimate'' in the [http://sara.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/saraWeb?qy=decimate British National Corpus], almost all clearly accord with the modern sense.  The only references to the original sense are two complaints about modern usage and its critics.  Interestingly, none of the 23 uses seems to mean ''reduce to one-tenth''.

Evidently the data used to support the OED entry were similar.
