Small village of 4.000 people, belonging to the municipality of Rome; located 25 km from the city center and 5 km from the Tirrenian sea to the west. Very close to the Tiber, it is inhabited since the Roman republican age, when it had the role of the port of Rome. Magnificent ruins of the ancient town are second only to Pompei. Ostia Antica has a lovely backcountry and a very nice medioeval castle.
