In [[music]] '''stratification''' is a layering of musical texture or the independent operating of more than one parameter simultaneously. According to Edward Cone, it is "the seperation in musical space of ideas--or better, of musica areas--juxtaposed in time; the interruption is the mark of this seperation." (DeLone et. al. (Eds.), 1975, chap. 1 and 2)
