====Usage note====
[[Neighborhood]] is Anglo-Saxon, and [[vicinity]] is Latin. [[Vicinity]] does not commonly denote as close a connection as [[neighborhood]] does.  A neighborhood is a more immediately vicinity. The houses immediately adjoining a square are in the neighborhood of that square; those which are somewhat further removed are also in the vicinity of the square.
