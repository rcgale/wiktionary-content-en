'''abanico aluvional''' ''m''

#[[alluvial fan]]

<!-- I'm looking for a good translation. They are the cone-shaped areas by which the rain comes down the mountain -->

*English: [[alluvial cones]] --><!-- this is just speculation and probably wrong -->

<!-- Google searches for "alluvial cone" and for "rain cone" return nothing, so I've commented out the speculative translation.  The Spanish looks like a singular in any case.

Google Language Tools gives "fan" [the sort you wave to cool yourself down] as a translation of "abanico".  Now, "alluvial fan" *does* give results on Google, and is also in Wikipedia.  I suggest that this might be the correct translation and have put it in, along with the Spanish gender.-->
