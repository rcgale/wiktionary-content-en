Bleh (pronounced "blair")
Used as an alternative to blah, or to fill in a void in a sentence. Not a real word by most dictionaries.

Example: "Emails can be seperated with dots, for instance blah.bleh@example.com instead of blahbleh@example.com"

Currently, blah is almost always used instead of bleh, but there is a poll to determine which is more aurally and aesthetically pleasing over at[http://freehost02.websamba.com/blahbleh/thepoll.asp blahbleh.tk].
