== Interjection ==

A nonsense word used as an example or to fill voids in sentences - used in the same manner as [[blah]]. "Bleh" is not recognised as a real word by most dictionaries.

Example: "You may put dots in your email address, so instead of blahbleh@example.com, you may register blah.bleh@example.com".

Currently, blah is almost always used in preference to bleh, but there is a poll being held to find out which is more aesthetically and aurally pleasing at [http://freehost02.websamba.com/blahbleh/ www.blahbleh.tk].
