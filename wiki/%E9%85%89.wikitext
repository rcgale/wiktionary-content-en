'''&#37193;''' - romanized ''yu<sup>3</sup>'' in pinyin and Yale, ''y√º'' in Wade-Giles.  It has seven strokes.  It derives from the pictogram of an ancient vase used in making and storing fermented millet liquors.  Although it remains associated with liquor, the character alone is mostly used as the 10th earthly branch in the Chinese cyclical calendar.

&#37193; is the 164th radical of the Chinese dictionary.  Compound characters such as [[&#37207;]] most commonly show the radical on the left of the character, and have some association with alcoholic beverages.

&#37193; is denoted in Unicode by hex 9149 or decimal 37193.
