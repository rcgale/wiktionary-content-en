*An ''accessory'' [[supposes]] a principal offender. One who is neither the chief [[actor]] in an offense, nor present at its performance, but ''accedes'' to or becomes [[involved]] in its guilt, either by some previous or subsequent act, as of [[instigating]], [[encouraging]], [[aiding]], or [[concealing]], etc., is an ''accessory''. 
*An ''accomplice'' is one who [[participates]] in the commission of an offense, whether as principal or [[accessory]]. Thus in [[treason]], there are no ''abettors'' or ''accessories'', but all are held to be principals or ''accomplices''.
