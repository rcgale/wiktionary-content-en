Usage note: The first definition has been criticized by usage writers although it is by far the most commonly used sense of the word. Many adverbs are used as sentence modifiers in this way without comment, like ''interestingly'', ''frankly'', ''clearly'', ''luckily'', ''unfortunately''â€”it is unclear why ''hopefully'' has been singled out for deprecation. Unlike for many such shifts in meaning that occur in English, The portion of the ''American Heritage Dictionary'''s usage panel that condones the first sense of the word has decreased from 1969 to 2000, offering the explanation that this particular usage has become a [[shibboleth]]. ''Merriam-Webster'', on the other hand, calls the usage "entirely standard".
