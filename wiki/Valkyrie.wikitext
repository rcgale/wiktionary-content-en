NOUN

In [[Norse]] [[mythology]], any of the female attendants, or [[handmaiden]]s of [[Odin]]. Said to be beautiful and to be armoured, they directed the course of battles and selected the most [[valiant]] warriors to die; half being escorted to [[Valhalla]], and the remainder to [[Sessrumnir]], the hall of [[Freya]]. Each night they would prepare banquets for the slain, and serve them liberally with food, beer, and [[hydromel]].
