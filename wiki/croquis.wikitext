Croquis drawing is quick and scetchy drawing of a live model. Croquis drawings are usualy made in few minutes after which the model changes pose and another croquis is drawn. This is good for the model because they don't need to keep their poses for a long time and good for the artist because it helps to concentrate on the essential elements of the pose. You simply do not have time to draw all the details so you'll learn to ignore them and concentrate instead on the important elements. It is also a good method of drawing those subjects which won't stand still and pose but rather keep on moving such as animals and children. Croquis drawing can then be used as a foundation for another work of art such as painting or as a work of art itself. The word croquis comes from france.
