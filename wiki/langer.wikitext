The term '''langer''' is possibly one of the most complex in [[Hiberno-English]], used in and around [[County Cork]] to cover a plethora of meanings. A langer can be an unpleasant person or a penis. "Acting the langer" is to be unruly and boistrous, or sneaky and unpopular; similar but not the same as [[asshole]]. Alternatively, is can imply that someone is merely joking - "I'm only acting the langer, boy". To be "langers" is to be very [[drunk]], also "langerated". The word has several variants, including "langball" and "langdang", both of which convey slightly different nuances in the sense of a disruptive, unpleasant, sneaky, conniving individual. It can also be used as a dubious [[term of endearment]] between friends; "ah shur 'tis the langer himself, la?" or "how's it going, langer?". As a pejorative term, it is usually applied to men. In [[2004]] a tune by the Cork group Natural Gas highlighted Cork's "ownership" of the term, with an unfortunately memoranble chorus declaring "in Cork he'd be known as a langer". The song reached the top of the Irish charts and was even edited into a [[dance music]] version, remaining bafflingly popular through the summer of that year. It is, overall, a musical insult (in every sense) and based on the melody of an older and infinitely better song [[A Man You Don't Meet Everyday]].
