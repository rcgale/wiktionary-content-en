===Noun===
'''langer'''
#(''County Cork slang'') a [[disagreeable]] [[person]], an [[idiot]].
 eg "See that langer over there?"

2 The male member.
eg "I've an awfully small langer."

3 "Acting the..." the act of being disagreeable.
eg "Ignore him, he's only acting the langer."

4 "Langered" the state of being remarkably drunk

eg "I'm langered" or "I'm langers". 

5 "A langerload" - a large amount.

The word can be used in several positions in the same sentence, though it rarely is.

eg "That langers langer was acting the langer after a langerload of drink and flashed his langer at me Ma. Some langer, boy."

Which translates roughly as:

"That drunken lout was acting anti-socially after drinking rather a lot and exposed his penis to my mother. He is quite the idiot."
