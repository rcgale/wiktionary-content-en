====Usage note====
The word can be used in several positions in the same sentence, though it rarely is.
eg "That langers langer was acting the langer after a langerload of drink and flashed his langer at me Ma. Some langer, boy."
Which translates roughly as:
"That drunken lout was acting anti-socially after drinking rather a lot and exposed his penis to my mother. He is quite the idiot."
