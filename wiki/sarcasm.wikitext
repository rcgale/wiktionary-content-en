===Noun===

'''sarcasm'''

#A [[keen]], [[reproachful]] [[expression]]; a [[satirical]] [[remark]] [[utter]]ed with some degree of [[scorn]] or [[contempt]]; a [[taunt]]; a [[gibe]]; a [[cutting]] [[jest]].

==Expanded Definition==

Sarcasm is the making of remarks intended to [[mock]] the person referred to (who is normally the person addressed), a [[situation]] or [[thing]]. It is often used in a [[humourous]] manner and expressed through particular [[vocal]] [[intonation]]s. This is often done by simply over-[[emphasizing]] the actual [[statement]], or particular words of it. Because it is vocally-oriented, sarcasm is often hard to pick up in written messages.

The word comes from the [[Late Latin]] word, ''[[sarcasmus]''], which, in turn, comes from the [[Greek]] ''[[sarkasmos]]'', from ''[[sarkazein]]'' - to bite the lips in rage,- from ''[[sarx]'', ''[[sark-]]'', ''[[flesh]]''.
