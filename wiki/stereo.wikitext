==English==
'''stereo'''

#recorded or broadcast sound that uses two or more speakers, each one playing a portion of the original sound to create an illusion of space and more accurately imitate the original sound. For example, a recording of a band playing will sound in stereo more like the band is in front of you, and each instrument will sound more real.
