'''stereo'''

#Recorded or broadcast sound that uses two channels, each one playing a portion of the original sound to create an illusion of spatial positioning and more accurately imitate the effect of the original sound reaching the ears. For example, a recording of a band playing will sound in stereo more like the band is in front of you, and with each instrument apparently positioned to the left, centre or right depending on how they were recorded.

#Images recorded photographically to emulate the view from each eye which, when viewed through a viewer, combine to give an impression of three dimensions.
