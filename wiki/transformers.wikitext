Transformers are plastic toys and cartoon characters that have been popular for many years (since 1984) and have managed to capture many childrens imaginations. Transformers features robots in a war (set in the future) with each other that can change from a state similar to a human to a different guise, for instance a vehicle or in the later, in the series Beast Wars, an animal.

The war started between two groups, the Autobots and the Decepticons and has progressed with the toy manufacturing world to produce a vast range of sets and collectable models. One of the secrets to their success was the hit TV animation that made the children and adult collectors want them in the first place, the craze then ensued. The series have included, Transformer: More than meets the eye, Beast Wars, Beast Machines and Transformers Armada.
