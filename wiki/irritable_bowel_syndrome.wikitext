<!-- the text below as been summarised above
Irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, is a problem that affects mainly the [[bowel]], which is also called the large intestine. The bowel is the part of the digestive system that makes and stores stool. 

The word syndrome means a group of symptoms. IBS is a syndrome because it can cause several symptoms. For example, IBS causes cramping, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation.

IBS is not a disease. It's a functional disorder, which means that the bowel doesn't work as it should. 

With IBS, the nerves and muscles in the bowel are extra-sensitive. For example, the muscles may contract too much when you eat. These contractions can cause cramping and diarrhea during or shortly after a meal. Or the nerves can be overly sensitive to the stretching of the bowel (because of gas, for example). Cramping or pain can result.
