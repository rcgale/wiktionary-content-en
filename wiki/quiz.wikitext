==Etymology==

There exist several etymologies for the word (noun):

1. Originally invented in 19th century by an english man who [[bet]] he could [[add]] a new [[word]] to the english language. He thus painted his new word on all walls in his hometown he managed to paint.
The morning after, everyone was talking about the new word.

2. The original meaning is [[interrogation]] (1867), being derived from the verb, which in turn had changed from meaning 2 to meaning 1 by influence from ''to question'' and ''[[inquisitive]]''. Current meaning only since 1941.

3. Originally ''quies'' (1847), may have derived from Latin ''qui es?'' (who are you?), traditionally the first question in [[oral]] Latin [[exam]]s. Used as a noun from 1867, spelling quiz first recorded in 1886.
