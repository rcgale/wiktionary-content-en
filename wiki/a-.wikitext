'''A-'''.

A, as a prefix to English words, is derived from various sources. (1) It frequently [[signifies]] ''on'' or ''in'' (from ''an'', ''a'' forms of AS. ''on''), denoting a state, as in ''a''foot, on foot, ''a''bed, ''a''miss, ''a''sleep, [[aground]], ''a''loft, ''a''way (AS. ''onweg''), and [[analogically]], ''a''blaze, ''a''[[tremble]], etc. (2) AS. ''of'' off, from, as in ''a''down (AS. ''ofd&umacr;ne'' off the ''dun'' or hill). (3) AS. [[&amacr;-]] (Goth. ''us-'', ''ur-'', Ger. ''er-''), usually giving an [[intensive]] force, and sometimes the sense of ''away'', ''on'', ''back'', as in ''a''rise, ''a''bide, ''a''go. (4) Old English ''y-'' or ''i-'' (corrupted from the AS. [[insep]]arable]] [[particle]] ''ge- '', [[cognate]] with OHG. ''ga-'', ''gi-'', Goth. ''ga-''), which, as a prefix, made no essential addition to the meaning, as in [[aware]]. (5) French ''&agrave;'' (L. ''ad'' to), as in ''a''base, ''a''[[chieve]]. (6) L. ''a'', ''ab'', ''abs'', from, as in ''a''vert. (7) Greek insep. prefix [[&alpha]]; without, or [[privative]], not, as in ''a''byss, ''a''[[theist]]; akin to E. ''un-''.

Besides these, there are other sources from which the prefix ''a'' takes its origin.
