'''a-'''

====English etymology====
Abbreviation of [[arc-]].
#(''mathematics'') Same as [[arc-]].

====Germanic etymologies====
Anglo-Saxon ''[[an]]'' or ''[[a]]'', on, in
#denoting a state, as in [[afoot]], on foot, [[abed]], [[amiss]], [[asleep]], [[aground]], [[aloft]], [[away]] (Anglo Saxon ''onweg''), and [[analogically]], [[ablaze]], [[atremble]], etc.
Anglo-Saxon, meaning ''of'', ''off'' or ''from''
#as in [[adown]] (Anglo Saxon ''ofd&#363;ne'' off the ''dun'' or hill). 
Anglo-Saxon ''[[&#257;-]]'' and Gothic ''us-'', ''ur-'', German ''er-''
#usually giving an [[intensive]] force, and sometimes the sense of ''away'', ''on'', ''back'', as in [[arise]], [[abide]], [[ago]]. 
Old English ''y-'' or ''i-'' (corrupted from the Anglo Saxon [[inseparable]] [[particle]] ''ge- '', [[cognate]] with Old High German ''ga-'', ''gi-'', Gothic ''ga-'')
#Making no essential addition to the meaning, as in [[aware]].
In modern informal speech, an "a-" is sometimes prefixed to adverbial or adjectival elements, such as gerunds, presumably prompted by its use in words like [[aware]], [[aloft]] or [[asea]]. Example: ''Gotta keep those loving good vibrations a-happening with her'' &mdash; Brian Wilson, ''Good Vibrations'' (1960s)

French ''[[Ã ]]'', from Latin ''[[ad]]''

#to, as in [[abase]], [[achieve]].

#from, as in [[avert]].

====Greek etymology====
Inseparable prefix [[&alpha]]; without, or [[privative]],
#not, as in [[abyss]], [[atheist]]; akin to English ''[[un-]]''.
