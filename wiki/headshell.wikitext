On a [[record player]], the '''headshell''' is attached to the end of a [[turntable]] arm and the [[cartridge]] is bolted to it.

Some headshells are designed to allow variable weights to be attached. For example, the H4-S Stanton Headshell comes with 2g and 4g screw-in weights. Extra weight can be useful to prevent skipping if the DJ is [[scratching]] the record.
