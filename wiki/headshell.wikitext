On a [[record player]], the '''headshell''' is attached to the end of a [[turntable]] arm and the [[cartridge]] is bolted to it.

Some headshells are designed to allow variable weights to be attached. For example, the H4-S Stanton Headshell comes with 2g and 4g screw-in weights. Extra weight can be useful to prevent skipping if the DJ is [[scratching]] the record.

On a Sun server the '''headshell''' is used to connect to a console between two Sun machines. It is made up of a DB-25 male connector with a normal Cat-5 ethernet cable connecting to another DB-25 male connector.
