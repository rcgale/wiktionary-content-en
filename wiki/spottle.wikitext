== Spottle ==
An funnel-shaped object, usually made out of a bottle with the bottom either cut (in the case of plastic) or broken (glass) out used to inhale [[marijuana]] smoke when [[spotting]]. 

The spottle may also be filled with ice to cool the smoke. Typically this will involve a plastic bottle where the bottom portion that is cut off is reversed and re-inserted to hold the ice in. Small holes are punched in the base to let the smoke into the ice compartment.

Alternatively (with glass bottles) the spottle may simply be stored in a freezer.
