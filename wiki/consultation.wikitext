1. An exercise carried out to establish detailed opinion on a particular subject.

Public consultations are carried out by [[government]]s and local authorities to gauge [[opinion]] before proceeding with a particular [[project]] or [[policy]]. In the UK, the [[law]] requires such consultations be carried out for certain practices.

In [[reality]], [[public]] consultations are often something of a [[sham]], as the consultation may consist of multiple questions phrased in such a way as to [[encourage]] respondents to give the [[answer]] that the authorities want. In addition, results of consultations are often kept [[secret]]. They thus have little [[credibility]] with the public.

2. An appointment or meeting with a [[professional]] [[person]], such as a [[doctor]].
