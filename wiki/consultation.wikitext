1. An exercise carried out to establish detailed opinion on a particular subject.

Public consultations are carried out by governments and local authorities to gauge opinion before procedding with a particular project or policy. In the UK, the law requires such consultations be carried out for certain practices.

In reality, public consultations are often something of a sham, as the consultation may consist of multiple questions phrased in such a way as to encourage respondents to give the answer that the authorities want. In addition, results of consultations are often kept secret. They thus have little credibility with public.

2. An appointment or meeting with a professional person, such as a doctor.
