====Usage notes====
*The list of examples following ''e.g.'' should not be exhaustive (in that case, ''[[i.e.]]'' should be used) and should not be followed by ''[[et cetera]]'' or ''[[etc.]]''  
*Place ''e.g.'' between parentheses when used in written text and follow by a [[comma]] when used in its function as "for example".
*Opinion is mixed about whether this term should be italicized or wtitten with a spearating non-breaking space as in ''e. g.''
