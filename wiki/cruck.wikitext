#:'''Quotations'''
#:*'''1952''': To construct such a house, it is necessary to select an oak with a branch growing out at an angle of about 45&deg;; the upper part of the tree, above the fork, having been cut off, the trunk and branch are roughly squared and divided in half .  If the two halves are then placed opposite one another, with the branch ends pegged together, they constitute what was usually known as a 'cruck' or, more correctly, 'a pair of crucks'. &mdash; L.F. Salzman, ''Building in England'', p. 195.
