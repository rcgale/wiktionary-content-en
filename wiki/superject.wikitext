===Quotations===
'''1925'''
''Thus the eternal relatedness is of the form &mdash; the είδος &mdash;; the emergent actual occasion is the ''superject'' of informed value; value, as abstracted from any particular superject, is the abstract matter &mdash; the ϋλη &mdash; which is common to all actual occasions and the synthetic activity which prehends valueless possibility into superjicient informed value is the substantial activity.''&mdash; Alfred North Whitehead, ''Science and the Modern World'' ISBN 0684836394
