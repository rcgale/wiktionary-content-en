'''joystick''' (''plural'' [[joysticks]])

#A [[mechanical]] [[device]] consisting of a handgrip mounted on a base or [[pedestal]] and typically having one or more buttons, used to control an [[aircraft]], [[computer]] or other [[equipment]].
<!-- unnecessary wordiness... These buttons are usually located at the top of the joystick for the thumb, and also may be located on the front of the joystick similar to trigger on a gun.  These buttons are used to send signals to a computer, machine or device, such as a robotic arm, an [[elevator]], or other types of [[industrial]] equipment.-->
