A '''joystick''' is a [[device]] consisting of a handgrip mounted on a base or [[pedestal]] and typically having one or more buttons which may be pressed.  These buttons are usually located at the top of the joystick for the thumb, and also may be located on the front of the joystick similar to trigger on a gun.  These buttons are used to send signals to a [[computer]] or [[video game console]], in order to send commands, instructions or action movement to a [[program]], usually a [[game]].  A joystick is typically designed to be gripped by the hand and operated by moving the grip around from side-to-side, forward, backward or to angles in-between.  The buttons on the joystick are often used in [[video games]] to initiate events such as the firing of a weapon or activating some object on the screen.
