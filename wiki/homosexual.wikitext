===Noun===
'''homosexual'''
# A person who, or, less commonly, an animal that, is homosexual; that is, attracted to others of the same sex.

====Usage note====
*Homosexual women are also known as [[lesbian]]s, a term preferred by many of them.  As ''homosexual'' applies to people of either sex, the expression ''homosexuals and lesbians'' is a [[pleonasm]] and is best replaced by ''homosexuals'' or ''lesbians'' alone as appropriate.
