A Hawaiian pharse that is part of the slang used up mainly in  [[Hawaii]]. The term is just a shorten version of "Do you know what I mean by this kind?"or "Do you know the kind I am talking about?" This term is used to indentify with other people if they are on the same subject or idea. Althou odd, this type of slang is not something somebody from the [[mainland]] would understand at first. In fact it would confuse most visitors who do not study the culture.

While the origin of the word cannot be confirmed at when it was used. It is safe to say it occurred after [[James Cook]] landed on the island and the people got educated into learning [[English language|English]].
