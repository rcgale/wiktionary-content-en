A derogatory slang term.  In [[role-playing games]] such as ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', a '''rules lawyer''' is someone who knows, or thinks he knows, even the most arcane and technical rules.  A rules lawyer may attempt to use his supposedly-encyclopedic knowledge of the rules to gain unfair advantage, to ingratiate himself with other players, or simply to annoy the [[Game Master]].
