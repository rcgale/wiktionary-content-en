<p> the character 'Pat' from the show Saturday Night Live is NOT a good instance of an ambisexual, for s/he had an ambiguous gender, as well as an ambiguous sexuality.

<p> i am a decent instance of an ambisexual sometimes to some people: i'm a male who sometimes wears eyeshadow or eyeliner,etc & triggers a question in peoples' minds & off their tounges "just what kind of sexuality are you running here?". if & when i respond "does it matter?", then to them i remain '[[ambisexual]]'.
