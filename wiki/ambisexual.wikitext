AMBISEXUAL [from ambi(guous) + (bi)sexual]
A person whose sexual orientation seems ambiguous.
*synonyms: gender-bender.
*etymology: 'ambisexual' is a genderalized cognate of 'bisexual'.

This word also relates to the recent coinage '[[metrosexual]]'.the character 'Pat' from the show Saturday Night Live is NOT a good instance of an ambisexual, for s/he had an ambiguous gender, as well as an ambiguous sexuality.

i am a decent instance of an ambisexual sometimes to some people: i'm a male who sometimes wears eyeshadow or eyeliner,etc & triggers a question in peoples' minds & off their tounges "just what kind of sexuality are you running here?". if & when i answer "does it matter?", i remain an 'ambisexual' to them.
