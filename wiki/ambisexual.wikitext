This word also relates to the recent coinage '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Metrosexual&action=view">metrosexual</a>'. <a href="ToBeContinued">Here</a>, i voice my impressions & connotations i have to the word 'metrosexual', which are different than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Metrosexual&action=view">the entry at wikipedia</a>.)

the character 'Pat' from the show Saturday Night Live is NOT a good instance of an ambisexual, for s/he had an ambiguous gender, as well as an ambiguous sexuality.

i am a decent instance of an ambisexual sometimes to some people: i'm a male who sometimes wears eyeshadow or eyeliner,etc & trigger a question in peoples' minds & off their tounges "just what kind of sexuality are you running here?". if & when i answer "does it matter?", i remain an 'ambisexual' to them.


Relatedly, in <a href="ToBeContinued">my personal definition of 'metrosexual'</a>, i address a related issue, & voice an alternative to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Metrosexual&action=view">Mark Simpson's personal cognotations to 'metrosexual'</a>.
