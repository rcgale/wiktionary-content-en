There is a Federal government indian reservation located about 50 miles west of Ashevlle, NC called the Cherokee Indian Reservation.  It adjoins the Great Smoky Mountains National Park which is located on the border of western NC and eastern Tennessee.  It is still currently home to many Cherokee Indians where the tribe was located prior to the "trail of tears" which if I am correct established the tribe in Oklahoma.  Cherokee, NC is a thriving tourist community with a school, hospital, casino, numerous churches, campgrounds, and a deep cherishished indian history that is the primary basis for it's tourist appeal.  Cherokee has capitalized commercially on it's rich indian history to the benefit of not only it's residents but also to the surrounding areas of western North Carolina and East Tennessee.  The Cherokee Chamber of Commerce can give you more accurate information.
