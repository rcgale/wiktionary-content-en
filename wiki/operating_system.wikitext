== Classifications and terminology ==
An operating system is conceptually broken into three sets of components: a user interface (which may consist of a  [[graphical user interface]] and/or a [[command line interpreter]] or "shell"), low-level system utilities, and a [[Kernel (computers)|kernel]]--which is the heart of the operating system.  As the name implies, the shell is an outer wrapper to the kernel, which in turn talks directly to the hardware.


            Hardware <-> Kernel <-> Shell <-> Applications 

In some operating systems the shell and the kernel are completely separate entities, allowing you to run varying combinations of shell and kernel (e.g., [[UNIX]]), in others their separation is only conceptual.
