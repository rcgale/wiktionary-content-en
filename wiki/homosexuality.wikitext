===Etymology===
From Greek ''homo'', '''same''' + [[sexuality]], from Late Latin ''sexualitas'', '''sexuality''', state of being male or female

===Noun===
'''homosexuality''' (''countable'')

#The state of being emotionally or sexually attracted only to persons of the same sex. 

====Usage note====
Homosexuality in women is also known as [[lesbianism]].  As ''homosexuality'' applies to people of either sex, the expression ''homosexuality and lesbianism'' is redundant and is best replaced by ''homosexuality'' or ''lesbianism'' alone as appropriate. Different cultural constructions of same-sex love are collectively referred to as ''homosexualities.''
