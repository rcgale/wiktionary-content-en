'''Bracketry''' is a word often used in the automotive industry to describe the mounting hardware used to hold one part to another. This hardware typically consists of stamped metal piece(s) that make up the actual bracket, and any other bolts, nuts, u-bolts, rubber etc. that are needed to complete the mounting of the part. It could also be described as a bracket "kit".
