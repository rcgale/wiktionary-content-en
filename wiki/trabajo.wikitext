===Noun===
'''trabajo''' ''m''
etim: lat. 'tripaliare'-'tripalium': a medieval instrument of torture made by three (tri) crossed sticks(palium). So, the spanish work is rather a punisment than the action that gives man dignity. Farmer's work, however, is 'labrar', a more grateful expression..., !but not  nowadaysÂ¡.
