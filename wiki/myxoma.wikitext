A '''myxoma''' is a primary [[tumor]] of the [[heart]].  Myxomas are usually located in either the left or right atrium of the heart (the left atrium is the most common location), and are typically pedunculated, with a stalk that is attached to the interatrial septum.  The most common location for attachment of the stalk is the [[fossa ovalis]] region of the interatrial septum.

It is often diagnosed during [[echocardiography]], when it is a pedunculated mass that is heterogenous in appearance.

The differential diagnosis include other cardiac tumors such as [[lipoma|lipomas]] and [[rhabdomyoma|rhabdomyomas]].  These other tumors of the heart are typically not pedunculated, however, and are more likely to infiltrate the muscle of the heart.
