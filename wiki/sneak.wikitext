===={{usage}}====
The past participle ''[[snuck]]'' has recently come into common usage, by analogy with [[strike]].  It is now acceptable in all but the most formal written Commonwealth English, but was rare prior to 1900.  This is the only irregual verb form to enter the language in several hundred years.
