'''Convection'''

The vertical movement of heat and moisture, especially by updrafts and downdrafts in an [[unstable]] air mass. The terms convection and [[thunderstorm]] are often used [[interchangeably]], although [[thunderstorm]]s are only one form of convection. Towering [[cumulus]] clouds are visible forms of convection.
