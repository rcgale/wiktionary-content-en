{Proof spirit} ([[Chem.]]), a strong distilled liquor, or mixture  of alcohol and water, containing not less than a standard  amount of alcohol. In the United States ``proof spirit is defined by law to be that mixture of alcohol and water which contains one half of its volume of alcohol, the alcohol when at a temperature of 60[deg] Fahrenheit being of specific gravity 0.7939 referred to water at its maximum density as unity. Proof spirit has at 60 [[deg.]] Fahrenheit a specific gravity of 0.93353, 100 parts by volume of the same consisting of 50 parts of absolute alcohol and 53.71 parts of water,'' the apparent excess of water being due to contraction of the liquids on mixture. 

In England proof spirit is defined by Act 58, George III., to be such as shall at a temperature of 51[deg] Fahrenheit weigh exactly the 12/13 part of an equal measure of distilled water. This contains 49.3 per cent by weight, or 57.09 by volume, of alcohol. Stronger spirits, as those of about 60, 70, and 80 per cent of alcohol, are sometimes called second, third, and fourth proof spirits respectively.
