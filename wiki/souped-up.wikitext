'''Soup-up''' refers to an item which is modified for higher performance.  It is often used in reference to automobiles, though its roots are equestrian.  The "soup" in the word refers to a concoction which would enhance the performance of a race horse.  Thus, a "souped-up horse" is one which has been injected with "soup".

The term is often misspelled "supe-up" (or "suped-up") today due to the prevalence of superchargers in souped-up automobiles.  This confusion may also be due to the similarity of the word, [[super]].
