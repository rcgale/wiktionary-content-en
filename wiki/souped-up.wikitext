'''suped-up'''

# Modified for higher performance.  The term derives from "supercharge", and entered the language in the 1950's from the [[hot rod]] subculture.  

The term is often misspelled as "Souped" up.   This is a case of a pun becoming pervasive enough that many people never realized the source of the term.  Humor writers in automotive magazines often repeated an apocryphal story of an ignorant person wanting to "soup up" his car, and asking whether to use chicken or tomato soup.
