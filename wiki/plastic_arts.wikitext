'''Plastic Arts''' are those visual arts that involve the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated in some way. Examples are clay, paint, plaster. Arts that can be said to be ''Plastic Arts'' are therefore [[Painting]], [[Sculpture]], [[Drawing]] etc. 

Materials that can be carved or shaped, such as stone or wood, or concrete are probably also included in this definition, since with appropriate tools, such materials are also capable of modulation.
