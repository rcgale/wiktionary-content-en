=== Usage note ===
The most common plural of ''opus'' in English is ''opuses''.  Some people use the Latin plural, ''opera''. ''Opi'' is fairly common in the field of classical music, though mostly in informal contexts.  The use of any of these three pluralizations may result in the speaker being corrected, though ''opi'' above all should be avoided in formal contexts.  Outside of music, the word ''opus'' sees particularly frequent use in the expression ''[[magnum opus]]''.
