===Noun===
'''axiom''' (''plural'' '''[[axioms]]''')

#{{logic}} A [[self-evident]] and [[necessary]] [[truth]], or a [[proposition]] whose truth is so evident at first sight that no reasoning or demonstration can make it plainer; a proposition which it is necessary to take for granted, such as  "The whole is greater than a part", "A thing can not both be and not be at the same time and in the same respect" or "No one gives what he does not have".
#An established [[principle]] in some art or science, which, though not a necessary truth, is universally received; as, the axioms of political economy.
