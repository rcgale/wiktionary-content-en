#:'''Quotations'''
#:*'''1786''': The hands were defended by [[Gauntlet]]s, these were sometimes of chain [[mail]], but oftener of small plates of iron [[rivet]]ted together, in imitation of the [[lobster]]'s tail, so as to yield every motion of the hand, some [[gauntlet]]s [[inclose]]d the whole hand, as in a box or case, others were divided into [[finger]]s, each finger consisting of eight or ten separate pieces, the inside [[glove]]d with [[buff]] [[leather]], some of these reached no higher than the [[wrist]], others to the [[elbow]]; the latter were [[stile]]d long armed [[gauntlet]]s: many of them are to be seen in the Tower; for a representation of one of them, see plate 26, fig 6. &mdash; Francis Grose, ''A Treatise on Ancient Armour and Weapons'', page 22.
