"'''Aspie'''" is a nickname given to people who have an Autistic Spectrum Disorder such as Asperger's Syndrome or High Functioning Autism (HFA). It is considered more friendly and affectionate than "person with Asperger's Syndrome", "person with a mild form of autism", and "Asperger's sufferer".

The female form of "aspie" is "[[aspiette]]", although "aspie" can be used to describe both genders.
