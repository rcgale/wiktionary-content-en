"'''Aspie'''" is a nickname given to people who have an [[autistic spectrum disorder]] such as [[Asperger's Syndrome]] or [[high-functioning autism]]. It is considered more friendly and affectionate than "person with Asperger's Syndrome", "person with a mild form of autism", and "Asperger's sufferer".

The female form of "aspie" is "[[aspiette]]", although "aspie" can be used to describe both genders.
