'''Au pair'''
# An au pair is a single girl (or, rarely, a boy) who helps a host family with childcare and/or housework while staying as a guest with a host family and generally receiving a small allowance (or pocket money). In many cases, the au pair is from another country and has aimed to learn a foreign language or culture during her stay.
