Dresden, Ontario is the home of Uncle Tom's Cabin. http://www.uncletomscabin.org/ The area is ripe with history, being the Canadian end of the Underground Railway.
Josiah Henson moved to Dresden in 1841 and helped established the Dawn Settlement. Legend has it that Josiah Henson was the model for Harriet Beecher Stowe’s famous book, Uncle Tom’s Cabin. It was after hearing Joshia’s story of his escape and life on the plantation that Stowe decided to write the book. The characters in the book were an amalgamation of the people that she heard about from Josiah Henson. Abraham Lincoln told her that her book helped start the Civil War between the north and south states. People in the north were very upset by what they had read in the book about the cruel treatment of the slaves and knew that something would have to be done to put an end to slavery. The Dawn Settlement (Dresden) was established to provide a refuge and new beginning for former slaves. The British American Institute was founded in the Dawn Settlement. This was a school that helped the slaves learn occupations so they could get jobs.
