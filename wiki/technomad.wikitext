'''Technomad''' is a term coined by [[Steven K. Roberts]] (amateur radio [[Callsign (radio)|call sign]]: N4RVE) to describe a nomadic person who remains connected through communications media, during travel, exploration, and online nomadic living.

==Early days of "nomadness"==
As the father of "technomadness", Steve Roberts began with the "behemoth". a human powered vehicle, equipped with [[amateur radio]] communications gear.  This pioeneering work has inspired many others to choose online nomadic living.

==Present day "nomadness"==
Later Roberts gravitated toward another online vehicle, the "microship".
