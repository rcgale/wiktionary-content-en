==English==
===Etymology===
[[nought]], zero + ''-ies'', plural of ''-y'', the ending of the multiples of ten from ''twenty'' to ''ninety'', in imitation of the names of other decades (''[[twenties]]'', ''[[thirties]]'', etc)

===Noun===
'''noughties''' ''plural''

#A proposed, slightly humorous, name for the [[decade]] from 2000 to 2009.

====Usage note====
*This is a recent coinage that has come about because of the lack of a word meaning "the numbers from 0 to 9".  Unlike the names for other decades, it is used only for the first decade of the [[twenty-first]] [[century]].  The first decade of the [[twentieth]] century is frequently referred to in the UK as the [[Edwardian era]] as it coincides very closely with the [[reign]] of King Edward VII.  Elsewhere, and for other centuries, terms such as ''at the [[turn of the century]]'' or ''in the early years of the century'' are used.
