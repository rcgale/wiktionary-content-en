'''existentialism'''

#  Philosophical movement harking back to Kierkegaard and flowering most notably in the work of Sartre and Heidegger in the mid twentieth century. It maintains, roughly, that the thinking subjects existence precedes its essence, and that our subjective existence, as thinkers, consequently is radically free, cannot be objectively construed, and is consequently incapable of any objective scientific characterization.
