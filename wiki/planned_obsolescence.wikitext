[[Obsolescence]] is the inferiority of a product to newer products even though it is still in good working order.

The term is also used in a broader sense to refer to a decision by a company to limit the features or quality of a product.

==Types of planned obsolescence==

===Technical or functional obsolescence===
*A new product does not interoperate with older products
*A product is unserviceable when it fails

===Style obsolescence===
Marketing may be driven primarily by aesthetic design. Product categories where this is the case display a ''fashion cycle''. By continually introducing new designs and retargeting or discontinuing others, a manufacturer can "ride the fashion cycle." Examples of such product categories include automobiles (style obsolesnce), with a strict yearly schedule of new models, and the almost entirely style-driven clothing industry (riding the fashion cycle).

==Obsolescence driven decisions==
Estimates of planned obsolescence can influence a company's decisions about product engineering; there is little business reason to make a product that lasts longer than anyone is expected to use it. Therefore the company can use the least expensive components that satisfy product lifetime projections. Such decisions are part of a broader discipline known as [[value engineering]].

==Quotations about planned obsolescence==

"Today the appearance of a motor-car is a most important factor in the selling end of the business&mdash;perhaps the most important factor&mdash;because everyone knows the car will run."&mdash;Alfred P. Sloan, General Motors
