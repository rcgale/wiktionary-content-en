[[Obsolescence]] is the inferiority of a product to newer products even though it is still in good working order.


==Types of planned obsolescence==

===Technical or functional obsolescence===
*A new product does not interoperate with older products
*A product is unserviceable when it fails

===Style obsolescence===
In product categories where product functionality is mature, marketing may be driven entirely by aesthetic design. Such categories display a ''fashion cycle'' in which a style's popularity rises, reaches maximum, and then declines as it spreads to lower-income customers. By continually introducing new designs and retargeting or discontinuing others, a manufacturer can "ride the fashion cycle." Examples of such product categories include automobiles, with a strict yearly schedule of new models, and the almost entirely style-driven clothing industry.

==Obsolescence driven decisions==
Estimates of planned obsolescence can influence a company's decisions about product engineering; there is little business reason to make a product that lasts longer than anyone is expected to use it. Therefore the company can use the least expensive components that satisfy product lifetime projections. Such decisions are part of a broader discipline known as [[value engineering]].
