[[Obsolescence]] is the inferiority of a product to newer products even though it is still in good working order.

'''Planned obsolescence''' is the determination by [[marketing|marketer]]s, in advance of a product launch, of date by which that product is expected to be made obsolete either by the manufacturer or its competitors. The term is also used, inaccurately, to describe any decision by a company to release a product that does not incorporate the most advanced technology available or conceivable. The charge of planned obsolescence is most often made against monopolies, which are accused of managing obsolescence schedules in order to maximize revenue.

==Types of planned obsolescence==

===Technical or functional obsolescence===
*A new product does not interoperate with older products
*A product is unserviceable when it fails
===Style obsolescence===
*Marketers emphasize changes in the styling of a product over changes (or lack of changes) in its functionality

==Obsolescence driven decisions==
Estimates of planned obsolesence can influence a company's decisions about product quality engineering; there is little business reason to make a product that lasts longer than anyone is expected to use it. Therefore the company can use the least expensive components that satisfy product lifetime projections.
