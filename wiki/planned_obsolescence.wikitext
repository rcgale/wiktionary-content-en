[[Obsolescence]] is when a [[product (business)|products]] is no longer wanted even though it is still in good working order.

'''Planned obsolescence''' is when [[marketing|marketer]]s deliberately introduces obsolescence into their [[product management|product strategy]]. The marketer's objective is to generate long-term sales volume by reducing the time between repeat purchases.  In a highly competitive industry, this can be a risky strategy because [[consumer]]s may buy from your competitors. There are also ethical considerations.

==Types of obsolescence==
===Technical or functional obsolescence===
*Companies introduce new technology which replaces the old (example: [[video tape]] -> [[DVD]]) 
*Obsolete products do not have the same functions or capabilities as new ones 
===Style obsolescence===
*Marketers change the styling of products so as to make owners of the old model feel 'out of date' (example: cars, clothing). They attempt to initiate fashions or fads. 
*A [[fashion]] is any style that is popularly accepted by groups of people over a period of time. A '''fad''' is a short term fashion.
*The '''fashion cycle''' is the repeated introduction, rise, popular culmination, and decline of a style as it progresses through various social strata
*Marketers claim that style changes relieve peoples' [[boredom]] and allows for both [[self-expression]] and [[conformity]] at the same time
===Intentional physical obsolescence===
*A product is designed to last for a specific lifetime (example: [[home entertainment]] electronics)
*If a product will be technically or stylisticly obsolete in five years, many marketers will design the product so it will only last for that time (this is done through a technical process called ''value engineering'' &mdash; great [[euphemism]]!)
*Doing this will reduce the cost of making the product, and lower the price to consumers (unless there is a lack of competition in the industry, in which case the cost reduction will probably not be passed on to the consumer in the form of lower price)
===Postponement obsolescence===
*Technological improvements are not introduced even though they could be (example: a large software manufacturer)
*The marketer feels either that consumers don't need the innovation or they are concerned that the new model will [[cannibalization|cannibalize]] the sales of their old model
*This will only work in a [[monopoly]] or oligipoly.
