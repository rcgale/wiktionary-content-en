[[Obsolescence]] is the inferiority of a product to newer products even though it is still in good working order.


==Types of planned obsolescence==

===Technical or functional obsolescence===
*A new product does not interoperate with older products
*A product is unserviceable when it fails
===Style obsolescence===
*Marketers emphasize changes in the styling of a product 
==Obsolescence driven decisions==
Estimates of planned obsolesence can influence a company's decisions about product quality engineering; there is little business reason to make a product that lasts longer than anyone is expected to use it. Therefore the company can use the least expensive components that satisfy product lifetime projections.
