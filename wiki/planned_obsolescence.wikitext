A [[consumer]] good is said to become [[obsolescence|obsolete]] when a new good, typically with more features or uses,  is introduced to supplant an older one. Non-tangible things such as jobs and ideas can also be said to become obsolete. 

'''Planned obsolescence''' is the conscious decision on the part of an agency to produce a consumer product which will become obsolete in a defined time frame.

==Types of planned obsolescence==

===Technical or functional obsolescence===
*A new product does not interoperate with older products
*A product is unserviceable when it fails
*Cost of repairs is impractical, based on replacement costs
*The manufacturer refuses to provide service or parts any longer. 

===Style obsolescence===
Marketing may be driven primarily by [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] [[design]]. Product categories where this is the case display a ''[[fashion]] cycle''. By continually introducing new designs and retargeting or discontinuing others, a manufacturer can "ride the fashion cycle." Examples of such product categories include [[automobile]]s (style obsolescence), with a strict yearly schedule of new models, and the almost entirely style-driven [[clothing]] industry (riding the fashion cycle).

==Obsolescence driven decisions==
Estimates of planned obsolescence can influence a [[company]]'s decisions about product [[engineering]]; there is little [[business]] reason to make a product that lasts longer than anyone is expected to use it. Therefore the company can use the least expensive components that satisfy product lifetime projections. Such decisions are part of a broader [[discipline]] known as [[value engineering]].

==Quotations about planned obsolescence==

"Today the appearance of a motor-car is a most important factor in the selling end of the business&mdash;perhaps the most important factor&mdash;because everyone knows the car will run."&mdash;Alfred P. Sloan, General Motors.
