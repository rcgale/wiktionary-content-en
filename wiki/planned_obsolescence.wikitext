[[Obsolescence]] is when a [[product (business)|products]] is no longer wanted even though it is still in good working order.

'''Planned obsolescence''' is when [[marketing|marketer]]s deliberately introduce obsolescence into their [[product management|product strategy]]. The marketer's objective is to generate long-term sales volume by reducing the time between repeat purchases.  In a highly competitive industry, this can be a risky strategy because [[consumer]]s may buy from your competitors. There are also ethical considerations.

==Types of planned obsolescence==

===Technical or functional obsolescence===
*Companies introduce new technology which replaces the old (example: [[video tape]] -> [[DVD]]) 
*Obsolete products do not have the same functions or capabilities as new ones 
===Style obsolescence===
*Marketers change the styling of products so as to make owners of the old model feel 'out of date' (example: cars, clothing). They attempt to initiate fashions or fads. A [[fashion]] is any style that is popularly accepted by groups of people over a period of time. A '''fad''' is a short term fashion.
*The '''fashion cycle''' is the repeated introduction, rise, popular culmination, and decline of a style as it progresses through various social strata. Marketers can ''ride the fashion cycle'' by changing the mix of products that they direct at various [[market segment]]s.
*Marketers claim that style changes relieve peoples' [[boredom]] and allows for both [[self-expression]] and [[conformity]] at the same time.
===Postponement obsolescence===
*Technological improvements are not introduced even though they could be (example: a large software manufacturer).
*The marketer feels either that consumers don't need the innovation or they are concerned that the new model will [[cannibalization|cannibalize]] the sales of their old model.
*This will only work in a [[monopoly]] or [[oligopoly]].

==Obsolescence driven decisions==
If marketers expect a product to become obsolete they can design it to last for a specific lifetime. For example, if a product will be technically or stylisticly obsolete in five years, many marketers will design the product so it will only last for that time. This is done through a technical process called [[value engineering]] &mdash; great [[euphemism]]! An example is  home entertainment electronics which tend to be designed and built to last until technical or stylistic innovations make them obsolete.

Doing this will reduce the cost of making the product, and lower the price to consumers (unless there is a lack of competition in the industry, in which case the cost reduction will probably not be passed on to the consumer in the form of lower price).
