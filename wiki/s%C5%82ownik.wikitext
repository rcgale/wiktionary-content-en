==Polish==
===Noun===
Słownik is a [[Polish language|Polish]] word which is usually translated as "dictionary", but it's usage is much wider than that. Almost anything that contains definitions of words is a "słownik".

While generally in Polish an [[encyklopedia]] is not usually considered to be a słownik,
specialist [[encyklopedia|encyklopedias]] often are thus called as in "Słownik Chemiczny".
