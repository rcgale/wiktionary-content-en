'''SHRIMP'''

#Sensitive High Resolution Ion MicroProbe

The SHRIMP essentially is a Secondary [[Ion]] Mass [[Spectrometer]] or [[SIMS]], with large turning radius and a double focusing setup, applying both an electrostatic analyser and a large radius [[magnet]] to separate mass species in the secondary beam.

The SHRIMP was developed in the 1970s to serve the need of [[geologist]]s to be able to conduct in situ U-Th-Pb [[geochronology]] on [[terrestrial]] and [[extra-terrestrial]] samples. The small primary beam sputters material from an area of 30 [[micrometer]] on the sample, making it a microprobe technique. The amount of target that is sampled is minute, making it a non-destructive method.

[[Mineral]]s commonly analysed and dated on the SHRIMP include [[zircon]], [[titanite]], [[rutile]], [[xenothime]], [[monazite]], [[zirconalite]] and [[badelleyite]].

The use of a primary beam of [[oxygen]] (for [[sputtering]]), precludes analyses of lighter elements, but application of a [[Cs]] ([[Cesium]]) source allows [[isotopic]] analysis of elements such as [[sulphur]], oxygen and [[nitrogen]].--[[User:202.72.148.102|202.72.148.102]] 05:07, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)
