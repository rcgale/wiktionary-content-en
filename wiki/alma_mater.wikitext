'''''Alma mater''''' is [[Latin]] for "nourishing mother".  It was used in ancient Rome as a title for the mother goddess, and in Mediaeval Christianity for the Virgin Mary.  In many modern languages it is principally heard as a a term of [[academia]].  Thus in the [[English language]]it is used, though less frequently than formerly,  as a [[sobriquet]] for the [[university]] or [[college]] a person has attended.  In [[American English]], it is also heard in reference to a [[high school]] or [[elementary school]].  Alma mater is sometimes the ''[[incipit]]'' of a school's anthem or song, and may be taken as a title for the genre.  

The word "matriculation" is derived from the Latin root word ''mater''.  The term suggests that the students are fed knowledge and taken care of by the educational institution.
