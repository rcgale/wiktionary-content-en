'''Bold text'''Metacognition'''Bold text''' The self-reflecting process that learners engage in to be aware of their own thoughts and knowledge improvements or refinements. 

Methods include asking reflecting questions subsequent or concurrent to learning tasks or cues, which elicit personal reflection about the learning process and outcomes. 

It is thought by contemporary teachers to be a valuable strategy, which most successful learners engage in naturally to some extent. Therefore it is explicitly taught and utilised across curricula to enhance learner performances.--[[User:203.173.175.202|203.173.175.202]] 10:47, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)Daniel Simunic june6th2005--[[User:203.173.175.202|203.173.175.202]] 10:47, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)
