The '''Gravy Train''' is an idiomatic expression which means to advance successfully without much work input.  It derives from the fact that gravy is a rich food, high in nutritional value, and a train, which can take you somewhere without you having to do anything other than to buy a ticket (or stow away).  The basic idea is that if you are on a train where much gravy is served, not only are you headed somewhere, but the way to get there is easy and full of comfort.

It probably came into wide use during the 1930's, the American Great Depression, when hobos who had lost their jobs were commonly stowing away on trains without paying for a ticket.  

The word 'Gravy' by itself, however, predates 'Gravy Train' to at least the late 19th century.  It was used as in interjection of pleasure at something that's easy to do with a great reward, or as an adjective to describe such a situation, ala 'Cushy'.
