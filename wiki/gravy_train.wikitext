"'''Gravy train'''" is an [[Idiom|idiomatic expression]] which is used to refer to any endeavor that can be completed without much work input.  It derives from the idea that ''[[gravy]]'' is a rich and luxurious [[food]], high in [[nutrition]]al value, and adds the idea of a ''[[train]]'', which can take you somewhere without you having to do anything other than to buy a ticket (or [[stowaway]]).  The basic idea is that if you are on a train where much gravy is served, not only are you headed somewhere, but the way to get there is easy and full of comfort. 

The word "gravy" by itself was used prior to the invention of the phrase "gravy train" as in [[interjection]] of pleasure at something that's easy to do with a great reward, or as an adjective to describe such a situation, Ã  la 'cushy'.

Johnson further states that the next day Kelson laughingly told him that the New Haven lockup was "a gravy train." '' "
