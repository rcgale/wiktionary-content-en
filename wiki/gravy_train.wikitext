== Gravy Train ==
The ''Gravy Train'' is originally derived from its definition, "to advance successfully without much work input."  Gravy Train is used in a comedical way in [[Cartoon Network]]'s Ed, Edd, and Eddy.  As reinterpreted by an idiot named Mike Marsocci, the gravy train is a time of complete jubilee, in which sometimes you are on the gravy train, and sometimes you are off of it.  A Gravy Monster is a seeker of this Gravy Train, one who would like to stay on it for as much a time as possible.  

Getting on the gravy train is possible in many such ways.  Having financial success or having a hott woman friend are examples.  It can also be brought upon by good grades or a long string of happiness and idiocy.

Expressing your feeling for your gravy train can be done by saying gravy over a 5 second period, extending the GR section of the word.  
 
Gravy Train can be described as an abstract concept more than an object, and is too obscure to be considered a theory or ideal.  This makes Gravy Train a phenomenon in human philosophy.

The Gravy Train is also used as the brand name of a dog food "Gravy Train Dog Food".  The slogan is very interesting to interpret.  
The Gravy Taste Dogs Can't Wait To Finish
Is this because the dog food tastes bad and the dog wants to get the meal over with, or is it just because dogs just plain eat fast?
