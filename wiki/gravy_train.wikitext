== Gravy Train ==
The ''Gravy Train'' is originally derived from its definition, "to advance successfully without much work input."  Gravy Train is used in a comedical way in [[Cartoon Network]]'s Ed, Edd, and Eddy.  As reinterpreted by an idiot named Mike Marsocci, the gravy train is a time of complete jubilee, in which sometimes you are on the gravy train, and sometimes you are off of it.  A Gravy Monster is a seeker of this Gravy Train, one who would like to stay on it for as much a time as possible.  

Getting on the gravy train is possible in many such ways.  Having financial success or having a hott woman friend are examples.  It can also be brought upon by good grades or a long string of happiness and idiocy.

Expressing your feeling for your gravy train can be done by saying gravy over a 5 second period, extending the GR section of the word.  
 
Gravy Train can be described as an abstract concept more than an object, and is too obscure to be considered a theory or ideal.  This makes Gravy Train a phenomenon in human philosophy.
