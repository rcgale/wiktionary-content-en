'''1855''': The word '''Hajj''' is explained by Moslem divines to mean “Kasd,” or aspiration, and to express man’s sentiment that he is but a wayfarer on earth wending towards another and a nobler world. &mdash; Sir Richard Francis Burton, ''Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah'', 1855, Appendix I.
