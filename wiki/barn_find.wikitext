A [[barn]] find is a valuable item recovered from an undeserving storage, usually in the countryside, where it lay more or less forgotten. Especially vintage [[automobile]]s are popular targets among professionals, who research individual [[Ferrari]], [[Porsche]], etc. car histories and roam the USA in hopes of finding and buying the cars. After a thorough [[restoration]], these vehicles are often [[auction]]ed off at great [[profit]]. See: http://www.velocetoday.com/cars/cars_52.php
