questions of humanity" and one of them  begins here, today's well-documented
tales!.. Notice it respectfully, please; this is a SAGA; man don't need to be
stressed... Avoid to show incredible angry attitudes or overwhelmed happy on
such tales.. Test your selfcontrol!.. Well, we are aware, there are a kind of
ineresting types, which fanatically programmed to see the similarly robotics and
they can not accept the creative brains... Compare yourself with them!..Take it
easy; don't to be prisoned of  "massmedial brainwashing campaigns"... In
normally case there  are different openviews, artistical creations, poetry,
approximate to the social cases in community; listen to them...  If you want to
criticize these stories, feel free; do that!.. No doubt!. This is a form of
litterature to create essays; of course built a bridge to say out your opinion;
do that, please!.. Otherways, you wil just a living witness here; yes, here
seems many aggressive robotics making shit after my tales; let them stay on this
page as my best evidence.. People needs such testimony; who tells saga, who has
shit in his mouth; discover on internet around my saga texts... They are not
only my enemies, because I have nothing private conflict with them... In fact
they are the fanatical enemies of humanbeing; this is the question...  My
Grandfader had piggies at farm; all the animals had name there and selected
examples prized by true ID cards... I see that Grandfather's true piggies were
more respectable than human faced piggies&doggies... Let's these doggies
shitting here on internet, mostly using false sexual announcements; let's people
witness what a kind kinky planet the two-legged piggies dreaming.. Keep the
evidences should be apparently pasted there on internet page, although it's not
friendly; all after checking this attack it'll easier to struggle against thus
kinky character, who beyond this dirtiness!.. Go on to tell what the newest!..
In fact, we have much more exciting broadcasting tournaments... Let's create new

- Swedish nuclear waste dumping, FM cahnnel reports on Mai 1992...				- Explain
shortly, please!										- Northern European Nuclear Information Group (NENIG)
February 1990In promoting its plans for their waste dump sites, NIREX
havefrequently compared their plans for a dump site dug deep intothe ground with
the existing dump at Fosmark in SvekJa Kingdom, wherethe low level waste from
the Swedish Nuclear Industry is to bestored. This site is built in the rock
underneath the BalticSea, with access being gained through a tunnel from the
land.While the Fosmark dump site is smaller than the planned Britishsite, its
existence does make arguing against the British Sitemore difficult than it would
be if Fosmark did not exist, orwas closed down.NENIG believes that the Fosmark
site is in itself a danger tothe health of the.Baltic, and, by existing, it
makes it moredifficult to fight the British dump site plans which are aserious
threat to the North Sea and North Atlantic. Wetherefore urge the Nordic Nations
to persuade SvekJa Kingdom to closedown the Fosmark site.																			**
- Nixon suggested nukes in Vietnam reports on February 28, 2002...
- Explain, please!
- A few weeks before ordering an escalation of the Vietnam War, President
Richard Nixon matter-of-factly raised the idea of using a nuclear bomb. The
notion was quickly shot down by national security adviser  Henry Kissinger. The
newly released Nixon tapes also record troubling discussions of minorities. 
NIXON'S ABRUPT suggestion, buried in 500 hours of tapes released Thursday at the
National Archives, came after Kissinger laid out a variety of options for
stepping up the war effort, such as attacking power plants and docks, in an
April 25, 1972, conversation in the Executive Office Building.
"I'd rather use the nuclear bomb," Nixon responded.
"That, I think, would just be too much," Kissinger replied.
"The nuclear bomb. Does that bother you?" Nixon asked. "I just want you to think
big."
The next month, Nixon ordered the biggest escalation of the war since 1968.
In a 1985 interview, Nixon acknowledged that he had considered "the nuclear
option." He told Time magazine: "I rejected the bombing of the dikes, which
would have drowned 1 million people, for the same reason that I rejected the
nuclear option. Because the targets presented were not military targets."
Nixon showed less regard for the North Vietnamese in his 1972 taped
conversations.
In a conversation from June, he told domestic adviser Charles Colson, "We want
to decimate that goddamned place."
- I remember, he added: "North Vietnam is going to get reordered. ... It's about
time. It's what should have been done long ago."

- Understanding Nixon?
- Maybe!.. Understanding your killer-candidate!... The conversations were in the
archives' largest-ever release of Nixon tapes. The material covers mostly the
first six months of 1972, including everything from Nixon's groundbreaking trip
to China to the early days after the Watergate break-in.
The tapes also include anti-Jewish comments, implying that the media are run by
Jews, and accusations that Robert Kennedy was not "a patriot."
With this release, historians and researchers for the first time are being
allowed to use their own recording equipment to copy the Nixon tapes. "The sheer
volume and contents of the tapes will give historians and others plenty of
research opportunities," said Karl Weissenbach, director of the Nixon
Presidential Materials staff at the archives.								- Yes!.. It's!.. The
archives now has made public roughly 1,700 of the 3,700 hours of conversations
Nixon taped. Most of the segments related to Watergate had been previously
released, but the new tapes contain a few additional conversations, as well as
full conversations where previously only excerpts had been available. The public
now can hear what was said before and after the infamous 18½-minute gap in the
Watergate tapes three days after the break-in and hear the full context of the
"smoking gun" snippet, which revealed that the president was interested in using
the CIA to derail the FBI's investigation of the break-in. "This time, you're
getting the total historical perspective and complete context surrounding the
Watergate break-in," Weissenbach said.

- Israeli Citizens'   Verification Team Visits Nuclear Missile Base in the
beginning  2000...

Following up on the UN's inspection teams in Iraq, and the efforts of
anti-nuclear activists around the world, an Israeli Citizen's Verification Team
decided to pay a visit to a no-longer secret nuclear missile base. The ICVT was
made up of anti-nuclear, peace, environmental, and political activists who
gathered to protest Israel's nuclear policy and the continuing imprisonment of
Mordechai Vanunu. (Including the Committee for Free Vanunu, Nuclear Holocaust 
Preventers, the Israeli Young Communist League and others.)

Our team arrived at 'Egozi' air force base, located in the area surrounded by
Revadim, Kfar Menachem, and Zacharya. The base does not appear on any map, and
the gate has no welcoming sign with the name of the base. The main entrance is
located at the end of a short access road that also leads to a nature preserve,
where tourists might stop for a picnic.

One member of the team used a Geiger counter to check radiation
levels. While the readings varied (1700 - 7,000), it was obvious that
they were more than 100 times the levels recorded in Jerusalem (.17).
I approached the gate to speak to the guard together with Smadar, who
held the Geiger counter. We showed the soldier, who told us he was a
reservist, the radiation levels we were reading. He was surprised and
interested. We explained that it was necessary to see the commander of
the base, to ask him to let our team inside to investigate the nuclear
weapons inside the base. He asked us what we would do if allowed
inside. I told him we would take notes for the UN and other bodies,
interested in reducing the risk of nuclear war. In the end I
explained why it was necessary for Israel to give up nuclear
weapons.

The other members of the team lined up opposite the gate, effectively
blocking it to traffic. They held up signs and banners calling for
nuclear disarmament, public debate on Israel's nuclear policy, and the
release of Mordecai Vanunu, who has spent nearly twelve years in
solitary confinement.

The duty officer arrived and asked me what I wanted. I told him that
he is suspected of planning war crimes to be committed in the future.
Nuclear weapons kill indiscriminately, destroying all life within a
particular radius, and permanently damaging the environment. Even if
never used on purpose, the existence of this base poses a risk to the
area in case of an accident. I reminded him that just following orders
was not considered a legitimate defense according to international
humanitarian law, and he should expect to be prosecuted for his role
in deploying weapons of mass destruction - if they should ever be
used. He was presented with a letter containing more in the same vein.


He refused to accept the letter, and informed the CVT that the police
had been called. After an hour, a single police vehicle arrived, with
two officers who did not have instructions to arrest anyone. After it
was made clear that we would leave rather than face arrest, they
seemed pleased and prepared to leave. At this point, the duty officer
came up to them and told them that someone was seen photographing the
base. The culprit was an American tourist who joined at the last
minute. He was terrified! In the end he was released without being
detained, due to the intervention of the taxi driver mentioned above.
The real photographer was never identified and photos are available
upon request.

The CVT left the site at approximately 6:00, promising to return again
with residents of neighboring communities. While the existence of the
base itself is an open secret in the area, information on the nuclear
issues at stake are relatively unknown.

Israel is confronted with two choices: a policy of peaceful relations
with the neighboring Arab states, backed up by conventional military
forces, or a policy of aggression backed up by non-conventional
weapons. As long as our government chooses the latter, other countries
have the impetus to develop non-conventional weapons of their own. The
alternative is built on enforceable treaties that will keep the Middle
East nuclear free. Including Israel.

													 - Is the Jewish military using depleted-uranium weaponsagainst the
Palestinians?
- Yes!.. International Action Center called for an investigation on 27 Nov 2000"
reported by John Catalinotto and Sara Flounders, the clip labelled as ;
"Depleted Uranium Education Project of the International Action Center": The
International Action Center calls upon international organizations, NGOs,
environmental and health organizations to investigate the Israeli military's use
of prohibited weapons in the West Bank and Gaza, and to mobilize to stop it.
These weapons include dumdum bullets and CS gas. The IAC believes it also
includes depleted- uranium weapons.
The effect of dumdum bullets and CS gas is immediate, easily shown and obvious.
Using radioactive and toxic depleted-uranium weapons is an additional crime that
has an insidious long-term effect, not only on combatants and civilians in the
vicinity, but over a broad area and to the general environment, as has been
shown by the Pentagon's massive use of DU weapons in Yugoslavia and especially
in Iraq.
The International Action Center's own investigative team on Nov. 1 and 2 saw
Israeli helicopter gun ships firing into densely populated areas. According to
international law these attacks on civilian areas are war crimes--as is the
long-term destruction of the environment from DU contamination.
Mobilizing investigations, public challenges and mass protests against the use
of DU weapons can stop this crime against humanity.
The aim of this paper is to show with supporting data that it is credible that
the Israeli military is using DU weapons in the Occupied Territories. We know
that Israel is DU-armed and capable, and shielding on Israeli tanks is
DU-reinforced. The IAC urges scientists, doctors and soldiers who know of the
use of DU shells to come forward with definitive proof that the Israeli military
has at least tested DU weapons in its attacks on Palestinian offices and homes.
In addition, we urge environmental and other organizations to demand an
accounting from these authorities.
It will also show how following similar Pentagon or U.S. government denials
regarding test-firing DU weapons in Puerto Rico, Okinawa Panama and south Korea,
revelations and public pressure have forced admissions and in some cases have
won pledges to stop firing DU weapons. In Kosovo, Yugoslavia, and in the
Persian/Arabian Gulf region this pressure has led to international
investigations and legal actions against DU use.
- DU is part of Usraeli arsenal?
- Yes!.. U.S. arms make up the major part of the Israeli arsenal and Israel has
been the number one recipient of U.S. arms aid for decades. These U.S. weapons
include the M1 Abrams tank—which fires DU shells and is armored with
DU-reinforced metal. The "Apache" and the Cobra helicopter gun ships are also
equipped to fire DU shells. Since this latest Intifada started, the U.S. has
shipped Israel "the newest and most advanced multi-mission attack helicopters in
the U.S. inventory," as reported in the Jerusalem Post. These were Apache
helicopters.
The IAC delegation witnessed Israeli attack helicopters, which people described
to them as "Apache" helicopters from the U.S., firing shells and rockets at
targets in and around Ramallah on Nov. 1. They then examined a small office used
by the Fatah organization that the projectiles hit and destroyed.
The following day they saw machine guns on tanks being fired at Palestinian
youths in Ramallah armed only with rocks and slingshots. They also visited a
Fatah office near Nablus that Israeli rockets had hit the night before.
The IAC delegation gathered up shell casings and metal fragments in these areas.
As they were preparing to leave from Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv, members of
the IAC delegation were stopped, searched and interrogated. The shell casings
and metal fragments were confiscated. While this prevented the IAC from
arranging its own tests, it made them even more suspicious that the Israeli
forces were using DU shells and trying to hide it.
Because of its great density, DU is also used to stabilize or balance airplanes
and missiles, including the Tomahawk Cruise missile. When the missile explodes,
or should the plane crash, the DU burns and is released into the air just as it
is when DU shells hit steel. DU is also used to shield tanks, including the M1
Abrams tank used by the U.S. and Israel. After 32 continuous days, or 64 12-hour
days, the amount of radiation a tank driver receives to his head from overhead
armor will exceed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's standard for public
whole-body annual exposure to man-made sources of radiation.
Whether from shells or from the scrapings from tanks moving around the
countryside, radioactive materials enter into the land, the water and the whole
food chain, contaminating the densely populated West Bank and Gaza, where water
is a scarce resource. Wanton radioactive contamination of this region is a crime
against all of humanity and a threat to the entire region now and for
generations to come.
According to the LAKA Foundation in the Netherlands, the Israeli army first used
depleted-uranium weapons in the 1973 war, under direction from U.S. advisers.
The same 1995 report from the U.S. Army Environmental Policy Institute mentioned
earlier asserts that Israel is one of the countries with DU munitions in its
arsenal. These included at that time at least Bahrain, Egypt, France, Greece,
Kuwait, Pakistan Russia, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the United
Kingdom, as well as the United States. This assertion has been repeated in the
Christian Science Monitor, the Jerusalem Post, the San Francisco Chronicle and
other newspapers.
Israel has a nuclear-weapons program more developed than that of any country
except the five major nuclear powers. For exposing this nuclear program,
Mordechai Vanunu, a nuclear-weapons technician, was kidnapped by the Mossad and
held in solitary confinement 14 years.
Given Israel's own nuclear program and well-developed military industry, the
likelihood is that Israel is a manufacturer of DU ammunition. The firm Rafael of
Israel is named in numerous reports as being such a manufacturer. But even if
this were not the case, Israel has been able to import DU weapons from the
United States. 													- Dangers from Depleted Uranium ?							- DU, much
like natural uranium from which it hardly differs, is both radioactive and
toxic. DU is a waste product of the process that produces enriched uranium for
use in atomic weapons and nuclear power plants. Over a billion pounds of DU
exists in the United States and must be safely stored or disposed of by the
Department of Energy. With its half-life of 4.5 billion years, the radioactivity
of DU is effectively eternal.
It is so abundant it has been given away to arms manufacturers. Because it is
extremely dense—1.7 times as dense as lead--when turned into a metal DU can be
used to make a shell that easily penetrates steel. In addition it is pyrophoric,
that is, it burns when heated by friction from when it strikes steel.
When DU burns, this spews tiny particles of poisonous and radioactive uranium
oxide in the air. The small particles can be ingested or inhaled by humans for
miles around, and even one particle, when lodged in a vital organ, can be
dangerous.
The Pentagon tested DU shells at various sites around the U.S., and used it
openly in combat against Iraq during the 1991 Gulf war. At least 600,000 pounds
of DU and uranium dust was left around Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia by U.S. and
British forces during that war.
Although the U.S. government and military continue to deny or minimize the
environmental and health dangers from depleted uranium weapons, they themselves
have to admit these dangers exist. A 1995 report from the U.S. Army
Environmental Policy Institute, entitled the "Health and Environmental
Consequences of Depleted Uranium in the U.S. Army" stated, "If DU enters the
body, it has the potential to generate significant medical consequences. The
risks associated with DU in the body are both chemical and radiological....
Personnel inside or near vehicles struck by DU penetrators could receive
significant internal exposures."
DU is also considered at least a contributing cause to the 130,000 reported
cases of "Gulf War Syndrome." Numerous international studies in Britain, the
United States and in Iraq have linked Gulf War Syndrome to the use of
radioactive weapons in the bombing. The chronic symptoms of this ailment range
from sharp increases in cancers to memory loss chronic pain, fatigue and birth
defects in the veterans' children.
The damage to the Iraqi people was even more severe. A symposium in Baghdad in
December 1998 found higher rates of childhood leukemia and other cancers in
people living around Basra, Iraq, and attributed this to DU contamination. Data
was presented on the pattern of a more than five-fold increase in many cancers,
a ten-fold increase in uterine cancer and a sixteen fold increase in ovarian
cancer and the high incidence of still births and congenital deformities,
especially in Southern Iraq.
- U.S. use of the weapons worldwide including DU?
- Definitely!.. The only admitted use of DU in combat has been in the 1991 war
against Iraq, the 1995 NATO bombing of Bosnia and the massive NATO assault on
Yugoslavia in 1999. There have, however, been other instances when the Pentagon
has test-fired DU shells in such a way that it has endangered nearby civilians.
Besides the many tests conducted within the United States, these include DU
testing at sites in Vieques, Puerto Rico; Okinawa, Japan; Panama and South
Korea.
- VIEQUES, PUERTO RICO ?!
- Count much more!... Vieques, an island near and part of Puerto Rico, has been
a Pentagon target-practice site since 1940. For the past few years and
especially since an errant U.S. bomb killed a Vieques resident in April 1999,
people in Vieques and all Puerto Rico have mobilized to stop the testing on that
island. As part of this mass mobilization, they have demanded that the U.S. Navy
fulfill its responsibility to the local environment and clean up
depleted-uranium shells it fired on the island.
While first denying it did such testing, in January 2000, Navy spokespeople
admitted firing 263 shells reinforced with DU during practice runs in Vieques,
claiming they did so "by accident." They said Navy forces were able to recover
57 rounds, leaving 206. Removing the DU contamination has remained one of the
demands of the movement in Vieques. Dr. Doug Rokke, former Director of the
Pentagon's Depleted Uranium Project, has condemned the Navy's use of DU in
Vieques and called in a Feb. 9, 2000 news release for "complete environmental
remediation of all affected terrain and medical care be provided for all
affected residents of Vieques."
- OKINAWA ?
- Yes!.. The U.S. government never notified Japan it was testing DU weapons near
Okinawa. Yet it turned out that a U.S Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jet in late
1995 had test fired 1,520 rounds of DU ammunition. The Pentagon finally admitted
this in an article published in the Washington Times on Feb. 10, 1997. This
created such a national outrage including angry denunciations in the Japanese
Duma that the U.S. government apologized, agreed to remove the weapons from
bases on Okinawa and make an extensive clean-up of the site.
As reported in the Japanese daily Mainichi Shimbun, Pentagon spokesperson
Kenneth Bacon said the U.S. military has moved all depleted-uranium bullets
deployed in Okinawa to south Korea. He also reportedly said that in south Korea,
the shells are closer to a "potential battlefield.
According to the Mainichi Shimbun article, a South Korean foreign ministry
source said the U.S.-puppet government in Seoul had not been informed of the
transfer. "If it is the case that the move was made to avoid further controversy
in Japan, it could disturb sentiments of the [south Korean] people," the source
reportedly said.
- SOUTH KOREA ?
- Always!.. And it did. U.S. Air-Force veteran turned peace activist during the
war against Vietnam Brian Willson reports on his May 2000 visit to South Korea:
"For Example, in May 2000, Koreans discovered that U.S.Air Force A-10s were
practice bombing at a 50-year-old bombing/strafing range (Koon Ni) near the
village of Maehyang Ri, fifty-five miles southwest of Seoul. On May 8, due to an
in-flight emergency, one of the A-10s quickly dropped six bombs outside of the
prescribed bombing area, damaging some houses in the village and injuring seven
residents. "Local Korean villagers have been vehemently opposed to the use of
their historic farmland for U.S. bombing and strafing practice ever since the
Korean government first provided the 5900-acre Koon Ni site free of charge to
the U.S. military in 1951. The Korean government does not even collect from the
U.S. the utility fees entailed for operating the range, now leased by the
Pentagon to the world's largest arm's manufacturer, Lockheed Martin. When people
inquired into the purpose of the A-10s, and asked for explanations for the
errant bombing, they discovered that A-10s were heavily used in Kosovo and
Serbia delivering DU-coated weapons. "The local people of Maehyang Ri demanded
an answer from the Korean government and U.S. military in Korea as to whether DU
weapons were being stored in Korea or used in any way during practice bombings.
Though at first officials denied presence of DU, incessant pressure by doubting
Korean people finally elicited an admission from officials of both the Korean
government and U.S. forces that, indeed, DU was present in Korea. It had been
moved there in February 1997 from bases in Okinawa, after the Japanese
complained of its presence there. And though Korean and U.S. officials denied
that they used DU in practices at the Koon Ni range, they did admit that on two
occasions in 1997, DU weapons were inadvertently expended in Korea."
- PANAMA ?
- Was easier...According to an article in the Aug. 20, 1997 Christian Science
Monitor, Rick Stauber, A member of the seven-person team that prepared the US
Department of Defense's report on leftover ordnance at three military firing
ranges in Panama, says during his investigation he was handed a report, listing
all US weapon testing from the 1960s to the early 1990s, that showed that 120mm
depleted- uranium projectiles were fired on Empire Range.
At first, U.S. Ambassador William Hughs denied Stauber's report. When the
Fellowship of Reconciliation brought this to the attention of Panamanian daily
newspapers, the strong reaction forced Washington to admit that the military had
at least stored DU shells in Panama to test their deterioration in tropical
climates. Stauber, a military consultant, said that they would then be obliged
to test fire at least some of the shells to see if they were functional.
- KOSOVO, YUGOSLAVIA ?
- Therefore only Slobodan Milosevic to the face pof trial, instead of the
Western profits...Early in NATO's war against Yugoslavia, on April 1, 1999, the
International Action Center sent out a news release charging the U.S. with using
DU weapons against Yugoslavia. While the Pentagon was trying to avoid comment on
this, Pentagon spokespeople had already told the media that the A-10 Warthog
anti-tank plane was being used against Yugoslav tanks in Kosovo. Finally
pressure on this question from the media forced the Pentagon to acknowledge use
of DU.
Still, NATO headquarters and especially the Pentagon withheld cooperation with
investigations of DU contamination of Kosovo. On Oct. 14, 1999, a United Nations
official who chairs the task force investigating the impact on the environment
of the 78-day U.S.- NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia said that NATO
officials had refused to cooperate regarding their use of depleted- uranium
weapons. Pekka Haavisto, task-force chairperson, said his team was unable to
determine the extent of pollution caused by uranium-tipped weapons. He said NATO
refused either to admit using the weapons or to cooperate with the task force.
Finally though, in a letter to the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan from NATO
Secretary-General,
Lord Robertson, it states:
"DU rounds were used whenever the A-10 engaged armor during Operation Allied
Force. Therefore, it was used throughout Kosovo during approximately 100
missions… A total of approximately 31,000 rounds of DU ammunition was used in
operation Allied Force. The major focus of these operations was in an area west
of the Pec- Dakovica-Prizren highway, in the area surrounding Klina, in the area
around Prizren and in an area to the north of a line joining Suva Reka and
Urosevac. However many missions using DU also took place outside these areas."
According to articles written October 2000 by Rainer Rupp in the Berlin daily,
Junge Welt, and by British journalist Felicity Arbuthnot, concern over DU
dangers have created problems involving both UN personnel and NATO-country
troops occupying Kosovo.
"Last week [Oct 14-20] the French government followed its Italian counterpart
and launched an investigation of the effects of spent depleted uranium shells on
its soldiers in Kosovo. Two Italian K-FOR (occupation) soldiers who were
stricken with cancer and who showed symptoms similar to those with Gulf War
Syndrome are to be flown from Kosovo to Rome in the near future.
"The Rome military prosecutor followed his colleagues in Milan, Turin and Venice
and set underway an investigation of the effects of DU- shells on Italian troops
in Kosovo. With this in the background the Portuguese defense minister has
decided to withdraw the Portuguese troop contingent from Kosovo. (Junge Welt,
Oct. 24)
Notice that in all these cases the military authorities at first either
stonewalled or denied that DU was being used, then wound up having to admit it.
- ISRAELI EL AL JET and ESTONIAN FERRY 1994 sins in the Baltic Sea?
- Thanks to the Nordic lapdogs, costed only a handful dollars... A flaming crash
of an El Al cargo jet in Bijlmer, a suburb of Amsterdam on Oct. 4, 1992, killing
43 people has been the target of ongoing research. The health consequences for
people in a whole section of Amsterdam has created an ongoing movement of the
Dutch Greens on the chemical and radiological toxicity of depleted uranium.
The El Al Boeing 747 jet had on board tons of chemicals, flammable liquids,
substances used in the manufacture of nerve gas and 1,500 kilograms of DU in the
form of counterweights. Both the nerve gas chemicals and the DU have long been a
topic of debate. The Dutch Ministry of Defense report "Health risks during
exposure to uranium" documented the radiotoxic effects of DU in the human body.
- THE GULF WAR ?
- U.S. veterans organizations have campaigned to demand investigation and
compensation for their extremely high incidence of chronic sicknesses among Gulf
War veterans. The U.S. government has denied their claims.
- IS ISRAEL USING DU IN COMBAT?
- Some may argue that because the Israelis are not firing against tanks—the
strongest military justification for using DU shells—but against unarmed or at
the most lightly armed and virtually unprotected opponents, there is no special
reason for them to be using DU shells.
This is true. But the same could be said for U.S. forces in Vieques, Panama,
Okinawa and south Korea, yet DU weapons were tested in all those places. Like
the Pentagon brass, the Israeli general staff would want to try out their
weapons under all conditions, especially in combat. Now that they are firing at
homes and offices in an attempt to punish the Fatah leadership, they would want
to see if DU shells penetrate concrete as they do steel and if this makes a
difference in battle.
The Israeli military has already shown its racist contempt for the Palestinians
by firing to maim thousands and kill hundreds of young people protesting the
occupation of their country, people armed in the great majority with stones and
slingshots. As of Nov. 20, over 240 people have been killed and over 8,000
wounded.
And the Jewish officers have a strong reason to use DU-shielded tanks. They want
the Israeli soldiers and their families to think that they are invulnerable in
their tanks and armored personal carriers shielded with DU armor. If the troops
grow ill months or years later from their constant exposure to radiation, that
is no longer a political problem for the generals. The same is true when they
handle shells and fire rounds from tank guns.
The Jewish peace movement and the families of the troops, should know that the
illusion of invincibility comes at a price. There has already been the beginning
of resistance among individual Israeli troops to playing the role of oppressor.
This movement should seriously consider the dangers of DU.
The first step to exposing and stopping this crime and its long-term impact is
to start a serious investigation of Israeli use of depleted- uranium weapons.
Sara Flounders and John Catalinotto are editors and contributors to the book
"Metal of Dishonor: Depleted Uranium" and organizers of the Depleted Uranium
Education Project based at the International Action Center in New York City.
Flounders returned Nov. 3, 2000, from a five-day fact-finding trip to the West
Bank and Gaza.
The DU Education Project of the IAC is not a scientific research organization.
But it has based its published material on the work of many prominent scientists
and anti-nuclear organizations to create an awareness of the Pentagon's reckless
disregard for all human life and for the future even in their limited and
conventional wars against small and developing nations.
The International Action Center is an organization committed to building
resistance to U.S. militarism, war and racism. The IAC attempts to link together

- Is Usrael using DU shells?
- Yes!.. We have a very important report here... U.S. ANTI-WAR GROUP DEMANDS
INVESTIGATION
- Example?
- Published for intnace here on Nov. 12, 2000... John Catalinotto wrote...
- Expalin, shortly please!
- A major anti-war organization in the United States is calling for an
international investigation of Israeli use of depleted uranium shells in its
attempt to repress the Al- Aqsa Intifada--the uprising of Palestinians against
the occupation.
The IAC is calling upon "international organizations, NGOs, environmental and
health organizations to investigate the Israeli military's use of prohibited
weapons in the West Bank and Gaza, and to mobilize to stop it. These weapons
include dumdum bullets, CS gas and depleted uranium weapons."
Sara Flounders, Co-Director of the IAC was in occupied Palestine from Oct.
28-Nov. 2, 2000, as part of a four-person IAC delegation. The delegation was on
a fact-finding mission and also delivered medical supplies to Palestinian
clinics and hospitals in the territories.
"Such use of DU weapons," says Flounders, "adds to the crimes the Israeli forces
are committing against the Palestinian population. Israeli helicopter gun ships
are firing into densely populated areas. According to international law these
attacks on civilian areas are war crimes, as is the long-term destruction of the
environment from depleted uranium contamination.
"The radioactive materials enter into the land, the water and the whole food
chain, contaminating the densely- populated West Bank and Gaza, where water is a
scarce resource. The wanton radioactive contamination of this region is a crime
against all of humanity and a threat to the entire region now and for
generations to come.
"We urge scientists, doctors and soldiers who have handled these weapons to come
forward with information. Information supplied this way in Puerto Rico, Okinawa
and south Korea recently have helped mobilize against DU use and put the
Pentagon on the defensive. This crime and its long-term impact must be fully
exposed and stopped."
- Pentagon hid DU use?
- Always!...The draft of a paper on DU the IAC intends to release Nov. 16 shows
that in Vieques, Puerto Rico, and in Okinawa, Panama and south Korea, the
Pentagon had either kept secret or denied using DU until popular organizations
challenged the U.S. military.
Following the protests, the Pentagon was forced to admit DU use. In Okinawa the
U.S. apologized and promised not only to no longer use DU but also to begin to
clean up spent DU shells.
In addition, movements in France, Italy and other NATO countries occupying
Kosovo have sparked official investigations of the dangers their troops face
from exposure to DU from shells fired by U.S. planes during the 1999 war. There
are reports that the Portuguese government will withdraw its troops because of
DU dangers.
Flounders told how the IAC delegation witnessed "Israeli attack helicopters,
which people described to us as 'Apache' helicopters from the U.S., firing
shells and rockets at targets in and around Ramallah. We then examined a small
office used by the Fatah organization that the projectiles hit and destroyed."
- ISRAELI AUTHORITIES SEIZED IAC'S MATERIALS ?
- Authorities of Mafia... They earn money as staff.. Yes!... "We also saw
Israeli tanks and other armored vehicles firing machine-gun rounds and larger
projectiles at youthful demonstrators in Ramallah," Flounders added. "We
collected some of the shell casings and metal fragments from the different
target areas to bring back to the United States for evaluation and testing."
Flounders said: "As we were preparing to leave from Ben Gurion Airport in Tel
Aviv, members of our delegation were stopped, searched and interrogated. The
shell casings and metal fragments were confiscated. While this prevented us from
doing our own tests, it made us even more suspicious that the Israeli forces
were using DU shells."
A 1995 report from the U.S. Army Environmental Policy Institute asserts that
Israel is one of the countries with DU munitions in its arsenal. Given Israel's
own nuclear program and well-developed military industry, the IAC believes
Israel is quite likely a manufacturer of its own DU ammunition.
The "Apache" and the Cobra helicopters--both used by the Israeli armed
forces--are equipped to fire DU shells. Also, the Israeli Sabra tank is modeled
on the Abrams M1A1 tank, which is also capable of firing DU shells.
DU is a waste product of the process that produces enriched uranium for use in
atomic weapons and nuclear power plants. Because it is extremely dense, when
turned into a metal DU can be used to make a shell that penetrates steel. It's
also pyrophoric; that is, it burns when heated by friction when it strikes
steel.
When DU burns, it spews tiny particles of poisonous and radioactive uranium
oxide into the air. The small particles can be ingested or inhaled by humans for
miles around. Even one particle, when lodged in a vital organ, can be dangerous.
At least 600,000 pounds of DU and uranium dust was left around Iraq, Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia by U.S. and British forces during the 1991 war against Iraq. A
symposium in Baghdad in December 1998 found higher rates of childhood leukemia
and other cancers in people living around Basra, and attributed this to DU
contamination. For some cancers the rates were 5 to 10 times higher than normal.
- Show me please a reason to refuse duty!
- DU is also considered at least a contributing cause to the 120,000 reported
cases of "Gulf War Syndrome." Numerous international studies in Britain, the
United States and Iraq have linked Gulf War Syndrome to the use of radioactive
weapons in the bombing. The chronic symptoms of this ailment range from sharp
increases in cancers to memory loss, chronic pain, fatigue and birth defects in
the veterans' children.
While the Pentagon continues to deny any great dangers from DU, the 1995 U.S.
Army Environmental Policy Institute study, entitled "Health and Environmental
Consequences of Depleted Uranium in the U.S. Army," stated: "If DU enters the
body, it has the potential to generate significant medical consequences. The
risks associated with DU in the body are both chemical and radiological....
Personnel inside or near vehicles struck by DU penetrators could receive
significant internal exposures."
DU is also used to make tank armor and is used in heavily armored Israeli
vehicles. Exposure to radiation for those remaining in the tanks for a long time
or from handling wea pons can be another source of danger.
"Like the U.S. generals who are the main supplier of Israeli weapons," said
Flounders, "the Israeli general staff are indifferent to protecting the
long-term health of their own rank-and-file soldiers, not to speak of their
racist contempt for the Palestinians.
"For groups inside Israel who oppose the repression of Palestinians, challenging
DU use could increase the conscientious resistance from individual Israeli
troops that has already surfaced."

- TWO PEOPLE ARRESTED DISTRIBUTING DEPLETED URANIUM EDUCATIONAL LEAFLETS AT
DAVIS MONTHAN AFB AIR SHOW in 2000
- Tell us, please!
- As part of the continuing effort to educate Tucson citizens and
military personnel about depleted uranium weapons at Davis Monthan AFB, two
Tucson men were arrested today, March 21, while exercising their First
Amendment rights at the Aerospace and Arizona Days Air show at Davis
Monthan.
Social worker Brad Czerny, 48, and journalist Jack Cohen-Joppa, 41,
were taken into custody Saturday afternoon as they handed out flyers
quoting U.S. government documents and international relief agencies
concerning the health hazards of depleted uranium munitions. The
educational leaflets advocated no political position, and also included
statistical information from international agencies about the effect of
current UN sanctions on the people of Iraq.

Both men were given the opportunity to cease their educational
effort and leave the base voluntarily, and both refused to abandon their
free speech rights while numerous other political and commercial vendors
engaged in political advocacy and commercial solicitations during what was
billed to the public as an "open house" at the Air Force Base.
After being detained for over two hours, the men were cited by
Tucson police for criminal trespass and released at the base gate on a
promise to appear in city court. Arraignment is set for March 31. Czerny
and Cohen-Joppa will plead not guilty, according to their understanding
that a public forum cannot legally permit some political expressions while
prohibiting others on the basis of content. Cohen-Joppa has twice
previously been acquitted of trespass at D-M due to similar circumstances
surrounding his arrest at air shows in 1988 and 1990.

More educational efforts are planned, including a late April speech in Tucson by
Dan Fahey, author of a recently released study on depleted uranium weapons and
their effect on U.S. troops serving in Desert Storm.

- What is that?
- An International Appeal to Ban the Use of Depleted Uranium Weapons
- Americans should read it!
- They prepared it!
- ?!
- Yes!.. It's double moral... This appeal Drafted by Ramsey Clark
- Explain, please!
- Depleted-uranium weapons are an unacceptable threat to life, a violation of
international law and an assault on human dignity. To safeguard the future of
humanity, we call for an unconditional international ban forbidding research,
manufacture, testing, transportation, possession and use of DU for military
purposes. In addition, we call for the immediate isolation and containment of
all DU weapons and waste, the reclassification of DU as a radioactive and
hazardous substance, the cleanup of existing DU-contaminated areas,
comprehensive efforts to prevent human exposure and medical care for those who
have been exposed.
During the Gulf War, munitions and armor made with depleted uranium were used
for the first time in a military action. Iraq and northern Kuwait were a virtual
testing range for depleted-uranium weapons. Over 940,000 30-millimeter uranium
tipped bullets and "more than 14,000 large caliber DU rounds were consumed
during Operation Desert Storm/Desert Shield." (U.S. Army Environmental Policy
Institute)
These weapons were used throughout Iraq with no concern for the health and
environmental consequences of their use. Between 300 and 800 tons of DU
particles and dust have been scattered over the ground and the water in Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia and Iraq. As a result, hundreds of thousands of people, both
civilians and soldiers, have suffered the effects of exposure to these
radioactive weapons.
Of the 697,000 U.S. troops who served in the Gulf, over 90,000 have reported
medical problems. Symptoms include respiratory, liver and kidney dysfunction,
memory loss, headaches, fever, low blood pressure. There are birth defects among
their newborn children. DU is a leading suspect for a portion of these ailments.
The effects on the population living in Iraq are far greater. Under pressure,
the Pentagon has been forced to acknowledge Gulf War Syndrome, but they are
still stonewalling any connection to DU.
Communities near DU weapons plants, testing facilities, bases and arsenals have
also been exposed to this radioactive material which has a half-life of 4.4
billion years. DU-weapons are deployed with U.S. troops in Bosnia. The spreading
toxicity of depleted uranium threatens life everywhere.
DU weapons are not conventional weapons. They are highly toxic, radioactive
weapons. All international law on warfare has attempted to limit violence to
combatants and to prevent the use of cruel and unfocused weapons. International
agreements and conventions have tried to protect civilians and non-combatants
from the scourge of war and to outlaw the destruction of the environment and the
food supply in order to safeguard life on earth.
Consequently, DU weapons violate international law because of their inherent
cruelty and unconfined death-dealing effect. They threaten civilian populations
now and for generations to come. These are precisely the weapons and uses
prohibited by international law for more than a century including the Geneva
Conventions and their Protocols Additional of 1977.

- GIJON, SPAIN: MEETING LAUNCHES MOVEMENT AGAINST DEPLETED URANIUM, reports on
November 30, 2000
- Explain, please!
- In the north coast city of Gijon in the Asturias province on Nov. 25-26, 2000,
some 500 progressives from around Spain joined about 30 international delegates
in a seminar to open a serious struggle in the country against the use of
depleted- uranium weapons.
Among the participants was a former United Nations official in Iraq, Dr. Hans
Graf von Sponeck, who resigned his post rather than direct the so-called "Oil
for Food" program backed by the United States, which he saw as continuing the
murder of Iraqi children.
Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, unable to participate because of a
trip to revolutionary-controlled areas of Colombia, sent a message of solidarity
and a call to ban DU arms internationally.
Since relatively few people in the Spanish progressive movement were well
acquainted with the use and dangers from DU arms, international experts
introduced these subjects. Others, including Spanish scientists and organizers,
also spoke on the political implications of DU use.
A special contribution came from those speakers representing the victims of DU
weapons. There was a strong delegation from Iraq, a speaker from Yugoslavia, and
U.S. and British veterans who suffer from "Gulf War Syndrome," for which they
believe DU poisoning is responsible.
The Committee in Solidarity with the Arab Cause and the Spanish Campaign for
Lifting the Sanctions on Iraq organized the conference. Gijon and other
communities of Asturias hosted the meeting. The University of Olviedo also
supported it. Asturias has provided medical care for hundreds of Iraqi children
suffering the effects of 10 years of U.S.-led sanctions.
- What is your testiomonies on DU?
- DU is a waste product of the process that produces enriched uranium for use in
atomic weapons and nuclear power plants. Much like natural uranium, it is both
toxic and radioactive. Over a billion pounds of DU exists in the United States
and must be safely stored or disposed of by the Department of Energy. With its
half-life of 4.5 billion years, DU's radioactivity effectively lasts forever.
DU is so abundant the government gives it away to arms manufacturers. Because it
is extremely dense--1.7 times as dense as lead--when turned into a metal DU can
be used to make a shell that easily penetrates steel. In addition it is
pyrophoric--that is, when it strikes steel, heat from the friction causes it to
burn.
When DU burns, it spews tiny particles of poisonous and radioactive uranium
oxide in aerosol form, which can then travel for miles in the wind. Humans can
ingest or inhale the small particles. Even one particle, when lodged in a vital
organ--which is most likely to happen from inhalation-- can cause illnesses from
headaches to cancer.
The Pentagon tested DU shells at various sites around the U.S. and used it in
combat for the first time against Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. It was very
effective in destroying Iraqi tanks, as well as their occupants and anyone in
the area. At least 600,000 pounds of DU and uranium dust was left around Iraq,
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia by U.S. and British forces during that war.
Although the U.S. government and military continue to minimize the environmental
and health dangers from depleted- uranium weapons, even they have to admit these
dangers exist.
DU is also considered at least a contributing cause to the 130,000 reported
cases of "Gulf War Syndrome." The chronic symptoms of this ailment range from
sharp increases in cancers to memory loss, chronic pain, fatigue and birth
defects in veterans' children.
Canadian DU expert Dr. Rosalie Bertell explained the similarity between DU used
in combat and uranium from a nuclear disaster like that at Chernobyl. The high
temperature forms tiny particles of uranium oxide in ceramic form, she said,
which can then be more easily transported long distances in the air and inhaled.
- SUFFERING IN IRAQ ?!
- Unfortunately, yes!.. The damage to the Iraqi people was even more severe. Dr.
Akram Abdel Muhsen, physician and director of the University Hospital of Basra,
Iraq, reported on the higher rates of childhood leukemia and other cancers found
in people living around Basra. These findings were first made public in a 1998
symposium
Dr. Mona Kammas is a professor of pathology at Baghdad University and director
of a study of the environmental impact of U.S. aggression against Iraq. At the
Gijon symposium, she reported on a paper that showed an almost five-fold
increase in cancers, a more than three-fold increase in spontaneous abortions,
and a nearly three-fold increase in congenital anomalies in a study group of
those exposed to combat.
The paper also reported on environmental damage due to the Pentagon's
destruction of the water-supply and sanitation systems and the destruction of
oil refineries and factories that used toxic chemicals in the production
process.
Iraqi researchers believe that the different relative frequency of various types
of cancer now as compared with before 1990 in the Basra region was a significant
indication of a major change, and that this pattern continuing long after the
war indicated that DU's impact was long-lasting.
Dr. Slavko Knezevic, a physician and professor at Belgrade University in
Yugoslavia, reported on the virtual ecocide that NATO bombers committed against
his country by bombing chemical plants and oil refineries in Kragujevac,
Pancevo, Novi Sad and other industrial centers.
He also said that Yugoslav researchers found evidence that the U.S. and NATO
fired much more than the 31,000 rounds of DU shells they admitted to after the
1999 aggression against Yugoslavia.
- IS ISRAEL USING DU?
- Yes, Usrael prepare a surprise to whole World; "Nuclear Winter"!.. A speaker
from the International Action Center in New York, John Catalinotto, told of the
Pentagon's wanton testing of DU in Vieques, Puerto Rico, Okinawa, Japan, south
Korea and Panama, and how the movement against U.S. occupation in each country
protested angrily against DU use.
Catalinotto is co-editor and a contributor to the IAC's book about depleted
uranium, "Metal of Dishonor." Five other participants at the Gijon seminar,
including Dr. Bertell, Dr. Siegwart-Horst Guenther, Dr. Ashraf al-Bayoumi and
U.S. Gulf War veterans Carole H. Picou and Dan Fahey, contributed to the book.
In each of the above countries, Catalinotto said, the Pentagon first denied
charges that it used DU. As protests grew, U.S. spokespeople were forced to
admit its use and in some cases even to apologize and promise cleanups.
Catalinotto then raised the question of Israeli use of DU weapons in its attempt
to suppress the current Palestinian uprising. He said this was likely given
Israeli possession of DU ammunition and its use of DU-capable tanks and
helicopters supplied by the U.S. The IAC has called for an investigation of
Israeli DU use and a movement to stop it, which would be a way of showing
solidarity with the Palestinian struggle.
- A session on the media distortion of DU use and war included British Labor
Party Member of Parliament George Galloway and Madrid television journalist Jose
Manuel Martin Medem. Galloway pointed out that the first world leader to use
chemical weapons against a civilian population was Winston Churchill.
Perhaps the strongest evidence of DU's dangers came from Picou, a retired U.S.
Army sergeant who suffers many DU- typical symptoms, and British Gulf War
veteran Ray Bristol, who spoke from a wheelchair. For both of these veterans,
the suppression of their stories by the military hierarchy virtually forced them
to seek out aid from the progressive movement and from Iraq, where they
developed a strong solidarity with Iraqi victims.
- We should STOP THE SANCTIONS!
- The world showed nonsense on such matters, unfortrunately!.. In the closing
session, the emphasis shifted to the grim results of the 10-year sanctions
against the Iraqi people, with a short message first from Iraqi anti-sanctions
leader Dr. Harith Al-Khashali.
Dr. von Sponeck was warmly welcomed as one of the few officials--UN or
otherwise--who resigned an important post rather than continue to serve in a
criminal, anti-human situation. He pledged to continue his fight against
sanctions, which he described as a real "weapon of mass destruction."
Carlos Varea, a leader of the organizations responsible for the conference, read
the . It included demands that the use of munitions made with DU be considered a
war crime and a crime against humanity, that the sanctions on Iraq be lifted,
that the UN secretary general take steps to analyze the effects of DU armaments
on health and the environment and prohibit the use of these weapons.
It also declared full solidarity and support to those persons affected by the
use of DU weapons in Iraq and Yugoslavia including war veterans. The meeting
also extended its solidarity to the Palestinian people.
Other contributors to the conference included Nacho Garcia Alonso, professor at
the Oviedo University; Paz Andres Saez de Santa Maria, professor of public
international law at Oviedo University; Bernice Boermans, executive director of
the International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms in Holland; and
Jose Ramón L. Patterson, journalist and director of the TVE Asturias Territorial
Center in Oviedo, Spain.

- PENETRATOR N-BOMBS THREATEN LIBYA, IRAQ, wrote David Muller
- Read it to me, please!..
- While it preaches global arms control, the US Clinton Administration is
stepping up the technological and nuclear arms race against the third world. In
early April 6 radar-evading B-2 "stealth" bomber were officially commissioned
into the U.S. nuclear strike force with a new generation of Penetrator N-bombs.
The weapons are the biggest enhancement of U.S. nuclear capability since the
cold war's end. The Pentagon. can now launch precision raids from its own soil
against command bunkers in Iraq or the kind of chemical-weapons factory the US
says Libya is building inside a mountain.
The 12-foot-long B61-11 drills deep into the earth before exploding in a small
blast whose shockwaves can crush targets hundreds of feet below, according to
information from the Los Alamos Study Group and Greenpeace. The organizations
charge that this new deployment is a dangerous attempt to expand the traditional
role of nuclear weapons from the deterrence of rival superpowers to pre-emptive
weapons for potential use against non-nuclear, Third World countries.The B61-11
is an earth-penetrating nuclear bomb that can be delivered by variety of U.S.
aircraft including F-16 fighter planes, B-1 and B-2 bombers, and possibly the
B-52 bomber. As a low yield earth-penetrating "mininuke," it could provide the
United States with a weapon that some say could be more realistically used than
larger nuclear bombs in regional conflicts.
"This new nuclear capability makes it obvious that decision-makers in the
Clinton Administration are expanding the post-Cold War role of nuclear weapons,"
said Greg Mello, Director of Los Alamos Study Group, a New Mexico lab watchdog
group."You have to ask, who are the targets: the Russians? or Third-World
countries?"
This earth-penetrating capability is intended for deeply-buried targets such as
command and control bunkers. Senior Pentagon officials ignited controversy last
April by suggesting that the earth-penetrating weapon would soon be available
for possible use against a suspected underground chemical factory being built by
Libya at Tarhunah. This thinly- veiled threat came just eleven days after the
United States signed the African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty, designed to
prohibit signatories from using or threatening to use nuclear weapons against
any other signatory, including Libya.
New technology or new modification?
The deep-earth Penetrator N-bomb, reignites debate over what constitutes a "new"
nuclear weapon -- a pointed issue, as U.S. policy since 1992 has forbidden
development of new weapons. US Congress passed a 1993 law restricting the
development of any nuclear weapons with yields less than 5 kilotons. But the
Department of Energy classifies the B61-11 is outside this law as a
"modification" of an existing weapon. The "11th modification" dropped from a
plane to slam into the earth at the speed of a .45-caliber bullet. the B61 is
engineered to explode after shallowly impacting the ground.
While weapons designers struggle against the definition of a new weapon, the
weapon represents a wholly new military capability or employs substantially new
technology in its nuclear package."This weapon is a new military capability. For
all intents and purposes it is a new nuclear weapon," countered Mello. "Those
who are newly targeted will not care if the weapon is 'new' or merely
'modified.'"
The earth-penetrating weapon was designed at Los Alamos and Sandia National
Laboratories. LANL scientists designed and tested the original B61 in the 1980s
and so had to certify that the changes and the stresses of earth penetration
would not impair the bomb's performance. Sandia National Laboratories shipped 10
dummy versions of the modified B61 bomb to the U.S. Air Force last month as
training devices, plus nine sets of customized bomb-handling gear.
The New Mexico labs and the Defense Department conducted drop tests of bomb
prototypes in Alaska and Nevada. New parts for the B61-11 are being manufactured
at Tennessee's Oak Ridge Reservation and at the Kansas City Plant in Missouri.
Assembly is taking place at an undisclosed location.
- New impediments to global disarmament?
- Another reporter explain that... William Arkin, columnist for the Bulletin of
the Atomic Scientist, says the project suggests the weapons labs' thirst for new
work still has a role in driving the arms race at a time when former senior U.S.
generals joined in December with counterparts from Russia and elsewhere to call
for the elimination of atomic weapons.
Joe Cirincione of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a Washington think tank that
specializes in conflict resolution says, "This does seem to be a sort of 'in
your face' policy at a time when the U.S. is trying to convince the rest of the
world not to develop nuclear weapons and to decrease their arsenals,". "For
those who think that these are problems that disappeared with the end of the
cold war, this is a wake-up call."
Enhancing the US atomic arsenal flies in the face of popular domestic sentiments
in America. A recent survey by the Abolition 2000 anti-nuclear coalition found
that a majority of Americans support the elimination of all atomic arms.
"Countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction has become the
latest rationale for building and using nuclear weapons," said Greenpeace
Nuclear Disarmament Campaigner Bruce Hall. "But efforts in the Pentagon and the
national labs to expand the roles for nuclear weapons undercut the work of other
Clinton administration officials to stem nuclear proliferation."
- George Bush administration?
- Weaker all others... It's a pocket mosquitos in the hands of Jewish lobbies...

- Ethnic Weapons For Ethnic Cleansing ...
- Who say that?											- Experts and Greg Bishop reported from London as
staff by A. P. Headline;  "Israel Develops New Weapons"...
- Go on, read it to me, please!
- Israel is trying to identity genes carried only by Arabs that could be used to
develop a biological weapon that would harm Arabs but not Jews, the Sunday Times
reported.

The newspaper attributed its report to unidentified Israeli military and Western
intelligence sources. It said Israeli scientists are working to create a
genetically modified bacterium or virus that only attacks people who carry
certain genes.

The paper said the weapon is seen as Israel's response to the threat of chemical
and biological warfare from Iraq and could be spread by air or through the water
supply.

The newspaper said the program is based at the biological institute in Nes
Tziyona, which it described as the main research facility for Israel's chemical
and biological weapons. According to the report, researchers have pinpointed ``a
characteristic in the genetic profile of certain Arab communities, particularly
the Iraqi people.''

The idea of such research has provoked controversy in Israel because of
parallels with the genetic experiments at Auschwitz by Nazi scientist Dr. Josef
Mengele during World War II, the paper said.

``Morally, based on our history, and our tradition and our experience, such a
weapon is monstrous and should be denied,'' Israeli parliament member Dedi
Zucker is quoted as saying. Officials at Porton Down, Britain's biological
defense facility, said such weapons were theoretically possible, the newspaper
said
If we are to believe a recent AP report culled from the Sunday Times (London) it
would appear that the Israelis have announced or intentionally leaked a report
that its military was considering the development of so-called "ethnic weapons."
The info is credited to "unidentified Israeli military and Western intelligence
sources" which generally brings up the red flags with regard to authenticity,
and more likely, the motive for such leaks. The article ends with a comment from
an unnamed source at Britain's "biological defense facility" that pathogens
which can kill on the basis of ethnicity are "theoretically possible."
This PR seemingly ignores the fact that this "theoretical possibility" was
recognized over 25 years ago, if not before. It was originally brought to the
attention of potential customers with the publication of an article in the
Military Review of November 1970. This journal for command-level military
personnel was published by the US Army Command and General Staff College in Fort
Leavenworth, Kansas. The feature, entitled "Ethnic Weapons," authored by Carl A.
Larson, outlines the history, desirability, and possibilities of engineered
biological pathogens which would affect only those races which historically have
no natural defense against certain "enzyme inhibitors." Larson is listed as head
of the "Department of Human Genetics at the Institute of Genetics, Lund, Sweden"
as well as a licensed physician. The Hippocratic oath was apparently not
administered in Sweden when Larson received his accreditation.

Larson explains that many of the chemical activities and functions within the
human body are caused by the interactions of enzymes. One of the more
significant activities enabled by enzyme chemical reactions are the contraction
and relaxation of muscle tissue. If the activities of these enzymes are blocked,
the victim will be paralyzed, even to the point of death by asphyxiation. Not
coincidentally, the enzyme-blocking action of compounds called organophosphates
were discovered in Germany in the 1930s when experimental insecticides killed
the people unlucky enough to have used them. This discovery led to the mass
production of a substance named "Trilon," later used to impressive effect in the
extermination of groups of people the Nazis considered little more than insects.
This substance and others of similar makeup became known as "nerve gas." A
concentration of 40 milligrams per cubic meter can kill in about 10 minutes.
Stronger agents were later developed which can do the job with a single drop on
the skin.

The author points out that genetic variation between races is mirrored in
concurrent differences in tolerance for various substances. As an example, it
has been noted that large segments of southeast Asian populations historically
display a lactose intolerance, due to the near absence of the enzyme lactase in
the digestive system. A chemical or biological weapon (CBW) which takes
advantage of this genetic variance could conceivably kill or incapacitate entire
populations, leaving invading armies relatively unscathed, as long as they are
ethnically homogenous, or the at-risk members had at least been prepared to
tolerate the attack. In effect, the poison or viruses would not be recognized by
their bodies.

The Sunday Times article states that Israeli researchers have "pinpointed 'a
characteristic in the genetic profile of certain Arab communities, particularly
the Iraqi people.'" This may be more palatable to westerners, since some
consider the Iraqi race the enemy, and excluding other Arab gene pools might
seem like a more "humane" way to carry on more studies.

Larson is even more explicit in a way that would probably never make it into the
mainstream press. In a passage that would make Doctor Strangelove proud, he
muses uncontrollably on the possibilities of genetically-sensitive chemicals to
subdue enemy populations: "Friendly forces would discriminatingly use
incapacitants in entangled situations to give friend and foe a short period of
enforced rest to sort them out. By gentle persuasion, aided by psychochemicals,
civilians in enemy cities could be reeducated. The adversary would use
incapacitants to spare those whom he could use for slaves." This was published
in a serious, staid professional journal read by US military strategists. He
concludes with the statement that "the functions of life [now] lie bare to
attack."

According to Charles Piller and Keith Yamamoto in their 1988 book Gene Wars,
Larson's article was the first time that the subject of ethnically targeted CBWs
was broached publicly, and that in "the military's private circles it was old
news." The authors further state that in 1951 the Mechanicsburg, PA Naval Supply
Depot was the site of a classified test using a benign organism delivered to
personnel to mimic the behavior of an actual bioweapon: "According to documents
declassified in the late 1970s, the site was chosen because 'Within this system
there are employed large numbers of laborers, including many Negroes, whose
incapacitation would seriously affect the operation of the supply system.'" The
black workers in the Depot were supposedly more susceptible to a strain of
Valley Fever than were whites, but instead of using the actual virus, a
substitute fungal organism was used. Valley Fever is more often fatal to blacks
than to whites. It was recently revealed that the truth and reconciliation
hearings in South Africa had presented witnesses who testified that scientists
working for the apartheid regime had pursued efforts along similar lines.

Another possible example of field testing of ethnic weapons (or at least an
interesting case for study by those interested in their development) may be the
famed "Four Corners" virus, which seems only to affect Native Americans living
in northern New Mexico and Arizona. Most reports identified or compared the
disease to the Hantavirus, which killed victims relatively quickly following the
occurrence of a prolonged fever and fluid which rapidly filled the lungs and
asphyxiated the patient. Supposedly contracted through deer mice droppings, the
mystery disease has claimed at least a dozen victims in the last ten years. The
most recent outbreak occured this last summer, coming on the heels of El Niño,
which the major news media blamed for the renewed threat. Some area residents
believe that the virus may have been released either accidentally or
intentionally from a bioweapons cache at Fort Wingate, an army facility a few
miles east of Gallup. The munitions storage at Wingate is now officially closed.

In the 28 intervening years since the Military Review article was published, the
study of genetics has advanced to levels undreamed of by Dr. Larson at the time.
The human genome project is slated to map all locations and functions of human
DNA by early in the next century. There may be little reason to doubt that
subtly selective and perhaps overtly unnoticeable biological agents can be
introduced into a native population simply by flying over a chosen area with
little more than a crop duster attached to the wings of a B52. The recent
revelation that Israel may be working on their own bioagent based on well-known
and tested principles may only be a psychological deterrent, but given the
well-documented history of ethnic weapons, there is ample reason to suspect that
the threat is not an idle one.

													- Karl MARX said; "Human power is its own end!"...
- That's right!... We have a radio conference in next month,  November 2002 
Comrade Raya Dunayevskaya prepoared a speech!									- About?												- 40th
anniversary of Missile Crisis..									- I understand, 1962 Cuban Missile
Crisis tested anti-war Left 					- Yes, it's.. Wish you listenwhat she prepared?
Maybe we can help to change any subjects?	- Let's to listen first!..											-
This fall the world remembers the 40th anniversary of the moment when, in
October 1962, life as we know it almost ended. In the Cuban Missile Crisis, John
F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.
With many of the ingredients for the analysis then having been recast for
today--including nuclear politics and a part of the Left that's lost its
critical capacities--we reprint excerpts of Raya Dunayevskaya's "Weekly
Political Letter" of Oct. 25, 1962. It was titled, "Marxist-Humanism vs. the
U.S. Blockade of Cuba, the Russian Missile Bases There, Fidel Castro's
'Selective' Party, ALL Playing With Nuclear Holocaust."   What we detected on
October 29, 1962 ; you know? My preliminary (Oct. 23, 1962) statement on the
newly created brink-of-war situation as a result of President John F. Kennedy's
blockade of Cuba, Nikita Khrushchev's missile bases there, and the impotence of
the UN the minute the two nuclear titans decide to unleash a war holocaust,
correctly stressed the following: "In opposing war, we make it clear that we are
opposed to BOTH nuclear giants: Russia and the U.S. Under no circumstances do we
get ourselves maneuvered into a position where we, for a single moment, sound so
much against either one of them that we APPEAR TO BE FOR THE OTHER. ABOVE ALL WE
OPPOSE WAR NOT ONLY AS "AGAINSTERS" BUT PRIMARILY BECAUSE WE ARE FOR A TOTALLY
NEW SOCIETY, ON NEW, ON HUMAN BEGINNINGS, FREE FROM EXPLOITATION AND
DISCRIMINATION, WHERE THE POPULATION TO A MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD HAS THE DESTINY
IN THEIR OWN HANDS, BEGINNING WITH THE WORKERS AT THE POINT OF PRODUCTION.  Here
I wish to develop this position on two levels: 1. the objective situation and
nearness of war; and 2. ramifications of this crisis for our existence both as
an organization and as a body of ideas, both on the question of continuous
activity and writings, beginning with the next issue of the paper [NEWS &
LETTERS].  Do you remember the first step; BEFORE THE BLOCKADE? A good deal of
illumination on both these factors can be gained if we take it out of the
present moment of crisis and see that which was inherent in it the day
before....Four days before the announcement of the blockade of Cuba, I stressed
that what was wrong with people who pretend that Russia is not in Cuba is that
they thereby cover up the fact that Russia is the greatest exporter of
COUNTER-revolution. It is easy to see counter-revolution when it is as direct as
it is in the outright squashing of a revolution, as the Russian destruction of
the Hungarian Revolution. It is not easy to see counter-revolution when it is a
question of PLANNED EXPLOITATION OF THE PROLETARIAT IN HIS DAILY LIFE. Yet these
Russian "technicians" have been sent there, among other reasons, in order to
compel the Cuban working people, WHO ARE RESISTING ANTI-LABOR LAWS, FIGHTING THE
DIVERSION OF THE CUBAN REVOLUTION FROM ITS ANNOUNCED HUMANISM TO
STATE-CAPITALIST CHANNELS, to compel them to produce more and more for less and
less, and at the same time leave their political destiny to "the party and its
leader."
Finally, those who can't get away from the spurious ground for argument
established by Communists for the special benefit of the liberals, to the effect
that if the U.S. has a "right" to bases in Europe, Russia has a "right" to one
in Cuba, fail to see that the Russian arms imported into Cuba are not one-tenth
of the threat to the U.S. THAT THEY ARE TO THE CUBAN PEOPLE. Small Cuba, even
when armed by Russia, is no match for the U.S. might, but it is a power against
the unarmed revolutionary underground, AND IT IS FOR THIS PURPOSE PRECISELY THAT
THEY ARE INTENDED.  Remember the second step; THE BLOCKADE AND THE MOVEMENTS
OPPOSED TO IT  Out of the clear blue, a few short days after he himself argued
against Republican opponents who urged a blockade, J.F. Kennedy made the
shocking, unilateral, war-like pronouncement of blockade. Outside of
Khrushchev's break-up of the summit as a result of the U-2 plane spy
incident,(On May 1, 1960, a U.S. U-2 spy plane piloted by Francis Gary Powers
was shot down over Russian air space, causing the breakup of a U.S.-Russia
summit on disarmament.) when the two nuclear giants were pitted against each
other with no intermediaries, the people of the world were never closer to the
brink of nuclear holocaust. The present confrontation is not limited to verbal
threats and busted summits. It is now clear beyond a peradventure of a doubt
that both Kennedy and Khrushchev are mad enough to plunge the world into
thermonuclear war. If a summit meeting should result and stave off the day, it
clearly will be only a delaying action. It is likewise clear that Cuba has
become the possible locale of the outburst, as Berlin has been and remains to
this day another focal point, BUT WHAT IS INVOLVED IS THE U.S.-RUSSIAN
COMPETITION FOR DOMINATION OF THE WORLD.  It is at this point that the movements
opposing war show their own negative character. The falling into a trap is
inevitable when one does not view positively what they are fighting FOR, instead
of only what they are fighting against. Thus though the Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament (and Committee of 100) are supposed to be for banning the bomb, they
had not a word to say against its spread to yet another country, in this case
Cuba. Obviously, the Trotskyites, along with the Communists, are not the only
ones who think of "good" bombs (Russian) and "bad" bombs (American). The
professional nuclear disarmament people have now discovered that, in Cuban hands
(or at least on Cuban soil for these are not really in Cuban, but in Russian,
hands), it inspires them to the following slogan, "Viva Fidel, Kennedy to Hell." 
OK, let's take up Fidel. Even without a bomb, he has moved so far away from the
revolution he led that it is hard to see what he is making of Cuba other than a
satellite of Russia, and I don't mean it only as a storer of missile bases, but
as an outpost of single party state-capitalism. In the misnamed speech,
"Marxism-Leninism," delivered on Dec. 2, 1961--nearly a year ago, that is--Fidel
expounded his conception of why an "integrated revolutionary organization," that
is to say, a single party in which the Communists and what was left of the July
26th movement, merged.(The July 26 Movement was a revolutionary group organized
to overthrow Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. Fidel Castro came to be its
leader.) From urging his comrades "to overcome (their) scorn for military
academies" through his love of The Plan ("I always had a plan") as against the
"anarchism" represented by opposition to him ("I am not going to ask what Manolo
Fernandez represented,(Manolo Fernandez was a Cuban union leader who was ousted
by the government shortly after Castro took power.) because I believe he
represented trash; he was a 'mad anarchist'") to his glorification of Khrushchev
("one has only to read Khrushchev's report to the 22nd Congress... The building
of socialism follows a well-beaten path by now"), this petty-bourgeois sees the
truly independent third road--against both U.S. and Russia--and for a new
humanist society, as an incursion of the "strict standard of selection" which
must characterize "a party of leadership." Now if only the workers will continue
to work, only harder, and agree that "The Ideal System of Government is the
Party System," he can continue to lead "collectively"--a la Khrushchev in
Russia.  Any one can--though it must be admitted that Fidel doesn't do it very
well--repeat generalizations of Marxism on the role of the working class. The
proof, THE ONLY PROOF, that it is a way of life, not a mere weapon of
propaganda, is its REALIZATION IN LIFE. No such thing is true in Fidel's Cuba
where not a single organ--from the trade unions to the peasant unions, from the
state to the party--is any longer controlled by the working people.
Nevertheless, because so many in the nuclear disarmament movement have been
forged as "againsters" rather than as proponents of a totally new society, the
Communists can set so fatal a trap for them that they forget what their very
reason for existence is--opposition to nuclear armament--and shout "Viva Fidel." 
On this life-and-death question, at this life-and-death moment, we can under no
circumstances allow ourselves to be swallowed up by this curious movement. If
nothing else can be left unsullied, let's at least make sure that our
Marxist-Humanist ideas remain the beacon for future generations as they are for
ours. Therefore we must unfurl our banner, and proceed with our opposition to
both poles of world capital, putting in its rightly subordinate place those who
"follow the leader," be that Khrushchev or Kennedy.  Remember the third step;
THE TESTING POINT  At the same time, we cannot minimize the totality of the
crisis by considering that Kennedy has finally exposed himself as no different
from the Republicans--who had urged blockade before and now urge
invasion--things will be in any way easier for the building of a
Marxist-Humanist movement. It is not only the Birchers that will take upon
themselves the role of extra "enforcers."(The John Birch Society is a far-right
organization founded in 1958 that vehemently opposed the Civil Rights Movement
and promotes homophobia, sexism, and anti-Semitism under the guise of
anti-Communism. Still in existence today, it has links with Religious Right
groups such as the Christian Coalition and Eagle Forum, as well as with Pat
Buchanan.) The hysteria created by the administration is much more ominous than
that by Sen. Joseph McCarthy who had no such power as Kennedy. Whenever a
political position was proven wrong, there were those among the Marxists who
tried to misuse a Marxist statement about the whip of the counter-revolution
helping the revolutionary development. Its ultimate tragedy was Stalin's idiotic
statement, "After Hitler, us." First, the statement about the whip of the
counter-revolution referred to it urging the revolution on WHEN IT IS ALREADY IN
PROCESS BUT HAS NOT YET REACHED FULL FRUITION, as say, between February and
before October 1917 when the Kornilov episode exposed Kerensky and allowed the
full development of the revolution.(Kerensky was a leader of the Provisional
government overthrown by the Bolsheviks. Kornilov was a reactionary general who
earlier tried to overthrow Kerensky.) In a non-revolutionary period, the
problems confronting Marxist-Humanism are made harder, not lessened, by the
blockade, for the man who has the means to start a nuclear holocaust does not
forget for a moment his power to press down upon the opposition to his
war-provoking policy.  Take even the minor question of Kennedy's timing his
announcement of nuclear bases in Cuba to when it would be most useful to the
Democrats running for election. Two percent one way or the other may win him the
election of a governor or a congressman. Once won--or lost--however, he has to
be concerned not with a 2% margin but with the fact that OVER 60% OF THE
AMERICAN ARE OPPOSED TO AN INVASION OF CUBA. As the capitalist ruler he is, he
then turns the power against his own people. Everyone who is not for his
suicidal policy becomes "the enemy."  Of course, we increase our activity, not
lessen it. Of course, we know the universal opposition to war and can build on
that. Of course, we build our organization along with developing our ideas
comprehensively, but we can do so only by being fully conscious of all the
obstacles in the way. This is why the preliminary statement emphasized that: 
"[W]e have no power other than those of ideas even as the working people have no
arms other than those of their labor power. Therefore it would be folly to act
as if by opposition we mean the kind of arms that only the bourgeoisie has.
THEY--both Kennedy and Khrushchev--have arms and ships and missiles and prisons
and jet bombers. They can afford to play games as to who is the 'aggressor' and
'deceiver' and who is the violated and deceived while they jockey for the best
position to attack. We refuse to get into any such arguments...Our position must
be as unique as it is, neither 'popular frontism' nor pretense to power"... 
Everything we now do--whether that be a frontpager, a pamphlet, an educational,
activity in a strike or picket line--must bear the positive stamp of
Marxist-Humanism and the totally new foundations for a truly human society....We
must learn to express our ideas clearly, in 25 words or less, that is to say,
with full consciousness that our time is not unlimited.  While we are under no
illusion that times of such heightened crises are propitious for building a mass
organization, we are sure that the new sense of urgency is just the impulse
needed to intensify our activity in a way that the meeting of the movement from
theory with that from practice will not be left to chance. It is a time of
testing of individuals as well as ideas and organization.

- The U.S. imperialists sparked the second nuclear crisis on the Korean
Peninsula in a planned and deliberate manner in a bid to aggravate the situation
there and isolate and stifle the DPRK at any cost by charging it with "nuclear
weapons development." Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.
- Referring to the U.S. motive, the FM Redaction says:   Through the second
nuclear crisis the U.S. sought, above all, to bedevil the improved relations
between the north and the south of Korea and between the DPRK and Japan and
strain the situation on the Korean Peninsula in a bid to keep the U.S. Forces in
South Korea for an indefinite period.  The U.S. caused the second nuclear crisis
on the Korean Peninsula with an eye to find a pretext for scrapping the
DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework and evade its responsibility for the delayed LWR
construction.  The strategic aim sought by the U.S. in the crisis is to invade
the DPRK by force under the pretext of its "nuclear issue" and destroy
man-centred Korean-style socialism as it encourages the world progressives.  The
U.S. has escalated the DPRK-targeted war moves, while talking about "dialogue"
and "peace". The U.S. belligerent forces are making endless war outcries after
taking military measures, crying out for a sort of "attack" on the DPRK.  Timed
to coincide with this, the U.S. imperialists launched together with the South
Korean military north-targeted adventurous Foal Eagle war exercise which is
going on in combination with Rsoi from March 19.  The final objective of the
U.S. criminal moves is to provoke the second Korean war. There must be a train
to ignite the war.
The second nuclear crisis is just to serve this purpose.
The U.S. is creating the impression that it is exerting "efforts" to render
"assistance" to the DPRK. But this is nothing but a political gimmick to build
up public opinion in favor of the U.S. before launching a war.  The DPRK and the
U.S. are technically at war. This situation is inching close to an explosive
phase.  The U.S. aggressive nature and its ambition to invade Korea remain
unchanged.  A war may break out in Korea any moment as its danger is becoming
real.  As no U.S. method would work on the DPRK, Washington seems to opt for
starting the second Korean war.
The army and the people of the DPRK are heightening their vigilance and keeping
themselves fully ready to cope with the U.S. belligerent forces' reckless
nuclear showdown aimed to carry out its strategy to isolate and stifle the DPRK.
It is the unshakable principled stand of the DPRK to reciprocate the good faith
and react to the hard-line with the toughest stand.
Invariable is the DPRK's principled stand to conclude a non-aggression treaty
through direct talks with the U.S. on the principle of impartiality, equality
and confidence and peacefully settle the second nuclear crisis on the Korean
peninsula. The DPRK has no place to step back and nothing to concede to the U.S.
The DPRK does not avoid any showdown with the U.S.
It is fully ready to counter any military actions of the U.S. against the DPRK.
The DPRK has the army-based policy, the most treasured sword, single-hearted
unity more powerful than any nuclear weapon and strong self-defensive power.
They are our life and soul and a master key to all our victories.

- I wonder what is the reason this story-teller uses a strange grammar.. Bad
english, according to the web administrations.... Worst than my chief's school

- I understand you, too!.. But you know, I met this autor, a clever girl who can
talk wonderful.. I mean, she is a successful person when she talks plenty
fluently on other matters...
- But why this girl tells her story in so incredible strange english?
- I try to explain!... Yes, I asked her about this flat language... She replied;
"When I wrote in correct english, pissed off by the bourgeoisie dominated
media"... So, after this explain I checked it and witnessed that she has
right...
- I wonder the majority been masochists nowadays?!
- Ye', it is stranger than language!... ... Maybe we are living in a period
there bourgeoisie living a social sickness like mass masochistical delusion
system... We piss off the normally attitudes...
- Also, you mean the autor aims to write good tales in bed grammar to fix the
barries of establishment on this sick medial world...
- Approximately...
- But she make folks laugh!... Please, watch this clip, super irritable bad
english.. She makes me laugh, too!...
- Sure!.. Story teller aims it... Otherwise, you are a living evidence that she
succeed to make laugh you like any other pieces of this oligarchical system!..
- What!?..

- This broadcasting clip remind me of  "the Invisible Writers".
- What does "invisible writer" mean?
- Many years ago I knew a grizzled old playwright named Ray. He lived off state
disability checks, carried his manuscripts in brown paper bags, and drank cup
after cup of black coffee, which I poured for him from behind the counter of the
coffee shop where I worked.  He had one piece of advice for me: "Read Othello.
If you want to be a writer you must first read Othello."  Ray was a blue-collar
guy who had never gone to college, but he had read Shakespeare, checked out from
the public library near the furnished room where he lived. Ray understood plot
because he had lived and experienced it. He was a born writer.  Over the years
I've met a diverse collection of writers who have never been published or earned
any academic credentials, yet whose claim to the title of artist is genuine.
These invisible writers are soldiers and bakers, convicts and salesmen, winos,
hairdressers, firefighters, farmers and waitresses. Their only qualifications to
literary authenticity are their writings and their desire to write. Often the
only time they have is stolen time, and their private scrawls end up on cocktail
napkins, penciled in the margins of receipts, on any piece of paper handy.  I
got to know Tom Carson during the first Gulf War, shortly after his platoon had
been sent to Kuwait. We never met in person. He had written to a co-worker of
mine who had moved on, leaving no forwarding address. When I saw the U.S.
military return address on Tom's letter, I decided to answer it myself. We began
a correspondence that lasted through the war and after he returned to Fort
Benning, Georgia.  During a hectic two months, Lt. Carson wrote 39 poems. His
themes were the regimented insanity of military life, isolation and loneliness,
the wind and rain of his soul. Carson wrote his lines in rare solitude, in a
barracks or a tent. During the day, he told me, the thoughts gathered in his
head; he censored them but the forbidden words found expression anyway, for even
the U.S. Army cannot discipline the imagination.  People imprisoned in
stultifying, menial jobs can summon, with even a minimal command of language,
something entirely private, unfettered and incalculably powerful. Most
importantly, it is something of their own creation that cannot be taken away.
The sense of purpose and identity that comes with being a writer, creator of a
private world, can be life altering. I've known truck drivers who are
natural-born storytellers; fishermen who paint starkly beautiful word pictures
of life on a crab boat in the Bering Strait. I met a barely literate ex-convict
whose short story about losing his wife and child in a revenge killing for a
gang crime he'd committed was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever read. I met
a ex-alcoholic who wrote about being abandoned by her husband. In a few simple
paragraphs this uneducated woman in her mid-50s expressed a universal sense of
loss in an entirely unsentimental fashion; something that cannot be taught in
any MFA program. My own father, a novelist who was never published, once wrote
about being fired for writing on the job – a chronic problem in his lifetime. He
worked on an assembly line in a factory that manufactured radios, and the
foreman caught him writing one day while the neglected radio parts moved past
him on the belt. "I was only half a radioman," wrote my father. "In my heart, I
was a poet." As Chester Himes wrote in "The Quality of Hurt": "No matter what I
did or how I lived, I had considered myself a writer....It was my salvation. The
world can deny me all other employment, and stone me as an ex-convict...as a
disagreeable, unpleasant person. But as long as I write whether it's published
or not, I'm a writer."  I met Celia at a roadside diner, where she cooked greasy
breakfasts for travelers whose faces she'd never again see. Writing, for Celia,
was a way of being elsewhere, of undoing, undreaming, her mundane daily life.
The monotony of her job and the deadening rituals she performed daily were the
inspirations for the poems she scribbled on used order tickets. To hate your job
and do nothing about it is a failure of imagination: a true life sentence. A
Frenchman I know who was a maitre d' at one of the Washington's finest
restaurants, possesses a novel he composed in the twilight time between the
lunch rush and the dinner hour. His joy on writing it was immeasurable. That it
may never be published did not faze him. The point is that he created it. He
finished it. It is his. "Fiction completes us, mutilated beings burdened with
the awful dichotomy of having only one life and the ability to desire a
thousand," Mario Vargas Llosa wrote. I've often looked for my old playwright
friend Ray's name in print, but have never seen it. I imagine him sitting in a
coffee shop somewhere, brow furrowed as he revises lines of his latest play,
completely absorbed in the world of his characters. I'm sure it frustrated Ray
at times, that his work went unrecognized, but it never occurred to him to quit;
just like it would never occur to him to stop breathing. It is not strictly a
tragedy that Ray's plays, the maitre'd's novel or Celia's poems remain
unpublished. Much of the work comes into being for private reasons of the heart.
If every sentence that was written was printed and bound we would drown in a sea
of words – as it is, thousands of books are hastily published, barely read and
forgotten. Writing itself is the aim, for it is writing, not publishing, that
transforms individual human experience. To write, even in obscurity is
worthwhile. As Samuel Becket put it, writing is a way of leaving "a stain upon
the silence."
- It's true!.. Wonderful described and we are listening  a kind of the "stain
upon the silence", just here...

- Fifty secret US bio and chemical weapons tests disclosed, comments on 2 july
2003 and continues: The US military conducted 50 highly-classified tests of
biological and chemical agents in the 1960s and 1970s to find out how they would
act in different environments and weather conditions, the US defense department
has disclosed.
The announcement Monday capped a nearly three-year investigation into so-called
"Project 112" and its outgrowth, "Project SHAD," which were carried out over
land and sea in various parts of the world -- from the Marshall Islands to
Panama, Canada and Britain -- and involved as many as 5,842 US troops.
"We were very fortunate to find the progress reports," said lead Pentagon ( - )
investigator Dee Dodson Morris, who made clear the project was so thoroughly
classified that its scope was not known even to top department officials. "They
served as a valuable template and a roadmap of sorts."
The origins of the program go back to 1961, when defense secretary Robert
McNamara ordered a series of tests to see if chemical and biological weapons
could be effective.
As part of that initiative dubbed "Project 112," the Joint Chiefs of Staff set
up a center at Fort Douglas, Utah, in June 1962 to manage the program.
It took the military nearly six months to have the tests up and running.
In January 1963, the Navy launched off the coast of the Hawaiian island of Oahu
a series of tests, code-named "Eager Belle", designed to determined whether
aerosols containing a biological agent could penetrate US warships.
During the experiment a Navy ship was sprayed from a tugboat with the non-lethal
bacteria Bacillus globigii "to evaluate the effectiveness of selected protective
devices".
With the Cold War in full swing, US war planners also wanted to know how deadly
nerve agents such as Sarin and VX would behave in subzero temperatures dominant
in winter time in much of the former Soviet Union.
Hence, experiment "Whistle Down" conducted between December 1962 and February
1963 at Fort Greely, Alaska.
As part of these tests several Sarin and VX-filled artillery shells, rockets and
land mines were remotely detonated near the Gerstle River.
To see how weapons of mass destruction could penetrated the jungle canopy, the
Pentagon went in early 1963 to the Panama Canal Zone to hold exercise "Big
Jack." It involved aircraft spraying simulant agents over the Fort Sherman
military reservation.
Britain and Canada were chosen for a series of tests code-named "Rapid Tan"
whose goal was to determine how long the nerve agents Tabun, Sarin, Soman and VX
would maintain their killing capabilities in a wooded terrain and open
grassland.
Under a shroud of secrecy, the deadly weapons were sprayed several times during
1967 and 1968 from crop dusters, or delivered by howitzer shells, over the
military test sites in Porton Down, Britain, and Ralston, Canada.
"Blue Tango" involved 20 experiments with spraying live E.coli bacteria that
could sometimes be deadly to humans over the Island of Hawaii between January
and March of 1968.
The Pentagon experimented even with releases of bacteria into the ocean to see
if biological weapons could be effectively delivered by a submarine.
As part of a 1968 series of tests dubbed "Folded Arrow," the submarine USS
Carbonero dumped Bacillus globigii into the ocean off Oahu "to demonstrate the
submarine weapons system capability to carry out an effective biological attack
against an island complex and a naval port facility."
The purpose of the Pentagon probe was to determine how many people could have
been affected by the experiments to handle possible health-related claims.
"I am pleased that our investigators were able to bring closure to this in-depth
investigation, and by replacing speculation and uncertainty with fact, to offer
the veterans of these tests some much deserved peace of mind," Assistant
Secretary of Defense William Winkenwerder said in a statement.

- Your experiences, Sir?
- I was temporary staff by homosexual Swede Hans Blix, when he drank much
Absolute Vodka I joined an "halfoffical" group and left him by his former party
friends at Jewish Fp...  This group ashould visit a secret place, so we kept us
away from journalists and many friends went to the "Secret place", it was a
little palace in district Strömburg... My friends were been guests at  this
little "palace" labeled "IDEA"... There works both male and female escorts, a
kind of official job, who escorted me to the hotel.....	Also, I remember only my
hotel suite and the escorts around me... 										- Your friend stayed another
place, like "palace" you said? Maybe the main palace of Carl Gustaf in Ekerö...
- No!.. In Central Stockholm, they calkled me for information.. They met with 
"foot-massage escorts" there...											- Where?
- Strömsborg, Stockholm...
- But I know that there is only one single building there...
- Friends told that a bulding labeled  "IDEA"... I met different  "foot massage
escorts" there, who came from Estonia, Laponia, Lithuania, Polonia, all the
working at this palace and talking very good swedish , but very bad english...
- You?													-  I enjoyed mnyself in hotel suite with such massage
masters... 					- They are talking bad?										- Yes!.. I had no idea on
language, enjoyed mayself...But why you are asking so much? 		- Because I know
them.. When I collected the UN troop for Balkan, so I visoited this palace and I
experienced the hospitality of this group..							- Massage?												- More
performed... This is the famous Swedish model, Evangelian Jewish hospitality...		
- Oh, tell more please!.. I know only two women there, Rasa and Gry...				-
Incredible!.. They were the group leaders of so called "Mammele escorts"... 			-
They showed us the touristical places of country...							- They showed us much
more... Mrs. Rasa KAIRIENE has a wonderful mouth to suck the cock of top
guests... Mrs. Gry Tina TINDE like much more performed positions for example
dublex, triplex and to try new XXX toys just at the office!..
- Typical Monica Lewinsky copies...
- Bill Clinton visited Stockholm two times and newspapers couldn't find a reason
for such surprises because journalists thought that Billy spent his time at
hotel...
- Not at hotel?
- Not at all... He choose this place, Strömsborg section!... when you visit
Stockholm, please come and take a walk around this "lovely" corner...
- And what then?
- Try!.. You'll surprise yourself and never forget...
- ?!

**
													- Did you know that the retired Britannians and Amis visiting
SvekJa Kingdom who almost aimed enjoying themselves at the fabulous foot massage
centers... Private centers I mean... Not the IDEA guest-rooms...
- Yes, it's famous industry... My friends from former batallion gave a private
address; Mårdvägen 26, 167 56 Bromma, north of Stockholm.  I have moblie and
called the Mammele and ordered a date for this night...
- Give me your mobile, please!...
- What!... What chocked you?!..
- Same women...											- Incredible!.. Give me her number!...
- Here; 08 is Stockholm, plus 4459093  Go on, dear!..
- No!.. Not the same, this is Mammele Tinde... Not the Gry Tina!.. 					- You

family...

- "Israeli Nuclear Policies Threaten World Peace", programme on tv now.. 
"Worldwide nuclear holocaust all part of Mideast's mini-state's foreign policy,
defense strategy.", reports by Michael Collins Piper
- Let's watch!..
- Most Americans have no idea that the possibility of a full-fledged nuclear
"suicide bombing" by the state of Israel itself is a cornerstone of Israel's
national security planning. However, there are some U.S. policymakers who have
dared to express their concerns about this dangerous policy, which is known as
what Pulitzer Prize-winning author Seymour Hersh referred to, in the book by the
same name, "The Samson Option."

As Hersh has documented—and Israeli historian Avner Cohen has confirmed it in
even more detail in his own book, Israel and the Bomb—Israel's entire national
defense policy (from its inception) was framed around the development of
powerful nuclear bombs. As Hersh makes clear, the Israelis are willing, if
necessary, to "blow up the world"—including themselves—if they have to do so in
order to defeat their Arab foes.

The so-called "Samson Option" for Israel is based on the well-known story of
Samson in the Bible, who—after being captured by the Philistines—brought down
Dagon's temple in Gaza and killed himself along with a number of Philistines. As
Hersh put it: "For Israel's nuclear advocates, the Samson Option became another
way of saying 'Never Again'."

The Sampson Option is a matter of concern—even for many high-placed American
policy makers who are otherwise staunch supporters of Israel—but this is not
something that has received widespread attention in the American press.

American Free Press reported one year ago that—buried in brief news notes in
some Jewish newspapers in early 2003—former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
had formally broken Israel's longstanding policy
of denying its nuclear weapons capabilities, although it was not reported in the
mass media in America. Peres admitted in a Feb. 20, 2003 speech in Jerusalem
that Israel did indeed have nuclear weapons. The Israeli leader made the
admission to a delegation from the Conference of Presidents of Major American
Jewish Organizations.(Despite all of this, most mainstream reports about
Israel's nuclear programs continue to state that Israel officially denies having
nuclear weapons, Peres' state-ment notwithstanding.)

This admission by Peres was particularly interesting because in 1999, many
American Jewish organizations reacted with alarm when then-President Bill
Clinton dared to mention Israel's nuclear program. On May 14, 1999, the
influential Jewish weekly, Forward, published an article expressing outrage that
"President Clinton is raising for the first time public concerns about Israel's
nuclear program."

The article pointed out that some 35 members of the U.S. Congress had written a
letter to Clinton expressing concerns about imprisoned Israeli nuclear engineer
Mordechai Vanunu, who was the first to publicly expose Israel's nuclear bomb
production program.

Responding in a letter dated April 22, 1999 to then- Rep. Lynn Rivers (D-Mich.),
President Clinton did more than just express his own concerns about Vanunu's
plight. Clinton also said: "I . . . share your
concerns about the Israeli nuclear program. We have repeatedly urged Israel and
other non-parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty to adhere to the treaty and
accept comprehensive International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards."

Forward reported that "Jewish leaders reacted with shock at news that Mr.
Clinton had weighed in on Mr.Vanunu and Israel's nuclear program," and cited the
reaction of Anti-Defamation League director Abe Foxman, who attacked Clinton,
saying: "I can't believe the president would send such a letter. These are very
sensitive issues. It is so judgmental."

Foxman's disgust with Clinton was not unique. Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice
president of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organizations, declared: "The president's reference to Israel's nuclear program
is surprising and disturbing. As far as we know it's unprecedented."

...m. m...
- ...means more cloakrats than visible holes?
- More doggies than bones!..										- It's true!.. Unfortunately, thus e-mail
list includes many polit-whores... Do you understand now why this WONDERFUL
DEMOCRACY (!) turned to some modernized Bali Tel Aviv mixed  "Big Brothel"? Why
forced the intelectuals to be silenced? What does it mean, systematically
dismissed masses to face elimination process? Where are the true advocates of
Child Rights, next generations?  Where are the true Human Rights activists?
Where are the true Work Rights fighters?  Well, the lie have no long legs and
the truth is anti-semitic; I mean look at the independent social researchers'
report  that including the reality on the dismissed cathegories, for example
honoured people eliminates even in the democratical masked circus, satellite
regime Sweden eliminate, here,  at least REGISTRATED 500.000 PEOPLE pursued,
half of them PERMANENT JOBLESS...
- It's true!.. Unfortunatelty, there are nowadays much more figures mostly
zionized whores.......you see, there are much more different characters
(unfortunately, few honoured,  majority of such chiefs are simply hired lapdogs
and clan members of Jewish lobbies, who get profites by the non-honoured ways,
for instance licking the kinky ass of Zion boss) and most of them ready to sell
their own children to the liberalized pedofilia markets only for a handfull Tel
Aviv made dollars...

**



- Dear listeners, readers, tv-viewers!.. Adieu!.. It was a new saga finished
here... Brave people makes these forums available to encourage intelligent and
open debate. Users are requested to participate in the spirit of good fellowship
and tolerance. The views and opinions expressed here do not necessarily
represent those of saga tellers.... "Living tales broadcasting" does not mean
"fantastical fairy tales", but aims to offer a solution for  "living questions
of humanity" and one of them  begins here, today's well-documented tales!..
Notice it respectfully, please; this is a SAGA; man don't need to be stressed...
Avoid to show incredible angry attitudes or overwhelmed happy on such tales..
Test your selfcontrol!.. Well, we are aware, there are a kind of ineresting
types, which fanatically programmed to see the similarly robotics and they can
not accept the creative brains... Compare yourself with them!..Take it easy;
don't to be prisoned of  "massmedial brainwashing campaigns"... In normally case
there  are different openviews, artistical creations, poetry, approximate to the
social cases in community; listen to them...  If you want to criticize these
stories, feel free; do that!.. No doubt!. This is a form of litterature to
create essays; of course built a bridge to say out your opinion; do that,
please!.. Otherways, you wil just a living witness here; yes, here seems many
aggressive robotics making shit after my tales; let them stay on this page as my
best evidence.. People needs such testimony; who tells saga, who has shit in his
mouth; discover on internet around my saga texts... They are not only my
enemies, because I have nothing private conflict with them... In fact they are
the fanatical enemies of humanbeing; this is the question...  My Grandfader had
piggies at farm; all the animals had name there and selected examples prized by
true ID cards... I see that Grandfather's true piggies were more respectable
than human faced piggies&doggies... Let's these doggies shitting here on
internet, mostly using false sexual announcements; let's people witness what a
kind kinky planet the two-legged piggies dreaming.. Keep the evidences should be
apparently pasted there on internet page, although it's not friendly; all after
checking this attack it'll easier to struggle against thus kinky character, who
beyond this dirtiness!.. Go on to tell what the newest!.. In fact, we have much
more exciting broadcasting tournaments... Let's create new saga examples and try
to build a wonderful socialistical saga-world for whole humanbeing; yes, for
human, dear!.. Solidarity regards from saga-teller, additional works of
studio-guests, followers on friendly tv channels...
