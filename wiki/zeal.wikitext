:: <i>I know it is no easy matter so to deepen or hollow the channel of a bar, that it may never after need clearing, and that the expences run high: but my <b>zeal</b> for promoting the advantage of this colony having prompted me to make reflections on those passes, or entrances of the Missisippi,</i> [sic] <i>and being perfectly well acquainted both with the country and the nature of the soil, I dare flatter myself, I may be able to accomplish it, to the great benefit of the province, and acquit myself therein with honour, at a small charge, and in a manner not to need repetition.</i>
