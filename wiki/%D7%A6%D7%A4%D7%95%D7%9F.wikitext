'''Tzafon''' ([[Standard Hebrew]] '''&#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503;''') is a word in [[Hebrew language]] that means "[[North]]". 

Its [[etymology]] is derived from the word "Tzafoon" - which means "hidden", since when the [[sun]] is the north it is [[night]] and therefore, the sun is hidden from us.

"Ha-Tzafon" &#1492;&#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503; is a term used by [[Hebrew]] speaking people in [[Israel]] to call the northern parts of the country - the [[Galilee]] and the [[Golan Heights]].
