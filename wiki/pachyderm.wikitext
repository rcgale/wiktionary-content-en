'''Pachyderm''' is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word, consisting of the words "pachy" meaning fat (thick), and "derma" meaning skin. So literally it means someone (or something) with thick skin. It is used to describe animals such as an [[elephant]] or a [[hippopotamus]]. It is also used to describe a person that is not affected by (does not care about) what others say about him/her (it has a negative meaning for that person). For a person it can also mean someone who is insensitive.
