"Winter rat" is a slang term, believed to have originated in or around Syracuse, New York, referring to an older, unattractive automobile, purchased for little money, to be driven during brutal Great Lakes winters while the owner's "good" car remains garaged and protected from corrosive road salt for the season.  In other parts of the country such a vehicle might be referred to as a "beater" car.
