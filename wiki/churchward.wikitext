=== Etymology ===
Uncertain.  Most believe it to be an occupational family name, a contraction of [[churchwarden]].  However, other hypotheses are that it is named after a location, being the name of people who lived near a church ([[church]] + [[-ward]]) or who lived in the particular ward of a town or village that comprised the church ([[church]] + [[ward]]).  An {{AS.}} root of '''Cyrceweard''' has been suggested, although that may have been simply constructed by inference, by combining the Anglo-Saxon roots of [[church]] and [[ward]], as there is little evidence of such a name.  ("[[cyrce]] [[weard]]" as two words rather than a single proper noun is, however, attested as the Anglo-Saxon for a [[churchwarden]] or [[sacristan]].)

The earliest recorded use of the spelling [[Churchward]] is in 1539.
