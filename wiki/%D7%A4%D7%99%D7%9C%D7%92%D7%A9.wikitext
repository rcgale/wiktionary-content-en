'''Pilegesh''' is a [[Hebrew]] term for a concubine with similar social and legal standing to a recognized wife, often for the purpose of producing offspring.

==Legal Characteristics==
As the concubine has rights equivalent to the wife, so too are the offspring on equal legal footing with children of the husband and wife.  
==Biblical Examples==
Several biblical figures have had concunines when they were not able to create natural children with their wives. The most famous example of this was Abraham and Sarah. Sarah, feeling guilty about her inability to give Abraham children, gives her maidservant Hagar to Abraham. Their unions created Ishmael. 

==Current==
Today, the act of acquiring a concubine is prohibited under Jewish law.
