'''Pilegesh''' is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term for a concubine with similar social and legal standing to a recognized wife, often for the purpose of producing offsprings.

==Legal Characteristics==
Although the concubine has rights almost equivalent to the wife, unlike a wife, a pilegesh is not offered a [[ketubah]] or a formal marriage contract. However, any offsprings created as a result of a union between a pilegesh and a man are on equal legal footing with children of the husband and wife.

==Biblical Examples==
Several biblical figures have had concubines when they were not able to create natural children with their wives. The most famous example of this was [[Abraham]] and [[Sarah]]. Sarah, feeling guilty about her inability to give Abraham children, gives her maidservant Hagar to Abraham. Their union created [[Ishmael]].

==Current==
Many Jewish thinkers, such as [[Rambam]], have declared that the the act of acquiring a concubine is prohibited under Jewish law. He has noted that concubines are strictly reserved for kings and that a commoner may not have a concubine or engage in any type of sexual relations outside of a marriage.
