A Pilegesh is a concubine. Several biblical figures have had concunines when they were not able to create natural children with their wives. The most famous example of this was Abraham and Sarah. Sarah, feeling guilty about her inability to give Abraham children, gives her maidservant Hagar to Abraham. Their unions created Ishmael. 

Today, the act of acquiring a concubine is prohibited.
