'''starboard'''

#The right hand of a ship or boat when facing the front, or [[fore]] or [[bow]].  Starboard does not change based on the orientation of the person aboard the ship or boat. Derived from the Scandinavian term "steerboard", which was hung off the right side of the boat, making it impractical to put the right side against a dock when in [[port]], hence the left side of the boat became known as the [[port]] side.
#(''Nautical'')One of the two traditional [[watches|watch]] aboard a ship standing a [[watch in two]].
