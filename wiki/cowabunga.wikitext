=== History ===

Most baby boomers can tell you that the first time he or she heard cowabunga was on the Howdy Doody Show, which ran on television from 1947 to 1960.

Eddie Kean, the show's main writer until 1954, invented the characters Chief Thunderthud and Princess Summerfall Winterspring. Chief Thunderthud was supposedly the founder of Doodyville, and began sentences with the nonsense syllable kawa. Anything that was good was "kawagoopa"; anything that was bad was "kawabonga." 

For reasons no one really knows, this word for 'bad' was adopted by Australian surfers in the 1960s. The spelling changed to 'cowabunga', and the term spread to surfers elsewhere. The term was picked up later by Bart Simpson on ''The Simpsons'' television show.
