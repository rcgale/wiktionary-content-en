# なら: A [[conditional]] [[particle]] appended to the plain form of a [[verb]]. Use of なら implies that the verb before なら succeeds the verb after なら in time. This is the opposite of the conditional particle [[たら]], which implies that the first verb will precede the second verb. Contrast:
#*[[友達]]が[[来る]]<u>なら</u>、私は[[ピザ]]を[[注文]]する。If our friends come, I will order pizza [first].
#*友達が来<u>たら</u>、私はピザを注文する。If our friends come, I will order pizza [afterward].
#*Another well-known contrast between the two conditionals is the popular public service announcement: [[飲む|飲ん]]だら[[乗る]]な。乗るなら飲むな。If you drink, don't drive. If you [are going to] drive, don't drink.
