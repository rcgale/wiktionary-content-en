#:'''Synonyms'''
#:*[[Handsome]], [[Pretty]].
#:*'''Pretty''' applies to things comparatively small, which please by their delicacy and grace; as, a '''pretty''' girl, a '''pretty''' flower, a '''pretty''' cottage.
#:*'''Handsome''' rises higher, and is applied to objects on a larger scale. We admire what is '''handsome''', we are pleased with what is '''pretty'''. The word is connected with [[hand]], and has thus acquired the idea of training, cultivation, symmetry, and proportion, which enters so largely into our conception of '''handsome'''. Thus Drayton makes mention of '''handsome''' players, meaning those, who are well trained; and hence we speak of a man's having a '''handsome''' address, which is the result of culture; of a '''handsome''' horse or dog, which implies well proportioned limbs; of a '''handsome''' face, to which, among other qualities, the idea of proportion and a graceful contour are essential; of a '''handsome''' tree, and a '''handsome''' house or villa. So, from this idea of proportion or suitableness, we have, with a different application, the expressions, a '''handsome''' fortune, a '''handsome''' offer.
