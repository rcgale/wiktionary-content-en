A '''daffynition''' is a [[pun]] format involving the reinterpretation of an existing word, on the basis that it sounds like another word (or group of words). 

Daffynitions are popular with children, due to their ease of creation. Otherwise they are considered a less dignified form of the pun, if such a thing can exist.

Examples

 [[Alarm]]s:         What an [[octopus]] is. (all arms)

 [[Oboe]]:           An English [[tramp]].
 [[pasteurization|Pasteurise]]:     Too far to see.
