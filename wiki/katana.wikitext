'''katana''' ([[刀]], かたな)

#A [[Japanese]] [[longsword]] (also known as a ''[[daitou]]'') that was made by folding the steel hundreds of times and placing a hardened blade edge on the cutting side, which when cooled gave it a distinctive curved shape which was well suited to slashing attacks and fast drawing from the ''saya''.  They were considered weapons of honor and treated extremely well since the [[samurai|samurai's]] life depended on the blade.  It consisted of the blade, a ''[[tsuba]]'' or hand guard and a ''[[saya]]'' or [[scabbard]] and was usually kept in a set with a [[wakizashi]] that was known as a [[daisho]].
