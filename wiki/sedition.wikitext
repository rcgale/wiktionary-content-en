The overt acts that may be prosecutable under laws proscribing '''Sedition''' vary from one legal code to another, and those legal codes have evolved in a history, which can be traced. So there is a history of the definition of what constitutes sedition and a sociology of sedition as well. 

'''Sedition''' is any conduct that tends toward insurrection but does not amount to [[treason]]. Sedition is directed against a [[government]], but without an overt act. Sedition includes subversion of a [[Constitution]] and incitement of discontent (or of resistance) to lawful authority.

Seditious acts include causing insurrection or disturbances in a state or a revolt against the legitimate authority. Sedition includes any commotion, though not aimed at direct and open violence against the laws.  

The difference between sedition and treason consists primarily in the ultimate object of the violation to the public peace. Sedition does not consist of levying war against a government nor of adhering to its enemies, giving enemies aid, and giving enemies comfort.
