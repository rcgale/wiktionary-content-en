====Quotations====
<blockquote>
In this great stretch of country
there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to
life.  There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement
upon the dull, grey earth &mdash; above all, there is absolute
silence.  Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in
all that mighty wilderness; nothing but silence &mdash; complete
and heart-subduing silence.

&mdash;Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in ''A Study in Scarlet''
