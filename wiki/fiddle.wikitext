==Etymology==
From the Middle English, ''fithele'', which comes from Old English, fithelere. Similar versions of the word are present in Old High German, ''fidula'' (now fiedle), Old Norse, ''fithla'' (later fiddel in Danish), Middle Dutch, ''vedele'' (Dutch is veel or vedel).

The ultimate root is unknown. Some argue that the similarity in Germanic variations can be explained by adoption and subsequent corruption of a contemporary Latin word, ''vitula, vidula''. This is known to have occured with the Romance languages eg. viol or viola in French, Portugese, Italian and Spanish. Others argue that the Germanic words have a uniquely Teutonic origin, but no earlier forms have been found.
