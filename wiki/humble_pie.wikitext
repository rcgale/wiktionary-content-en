To '''eat humble pie''', in common usage, is to apologise and face humiliation for a serious error.

The expression derives from '''umble pie''', which was a [[pie]] filled with [[liver]], [[heart]] and other [[offal]], especially of [[deer]].  These parts were known as '''umbles''', and since they were considered inferior food, in [[medieval]] times the pie was often served to lower-class people.

Although "umbles" and the modern word "humble" are etymologically unrelated, each word has appeared both with and without the initial "h" after the Middle Ages until the [[19th century]].  The similarity of the two words was probably a significant factor in the evolution of "eat humble pie" as an [[idiom]].
