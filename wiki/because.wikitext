===Etymology===
[[Middle English]] '''bi cause''' ("by cause"), a calque of French [[par cause]]; [[by]] + [[cause]]. In Middle English, it was frequently followed by a subordinate clause introduced by [[that]] or [[why]].
:*'''[[By]]''' < Middle English '''bi''' < Old English '''[[bi#Old English|bī]]''' < Proto-Germanic '''[[*bi]]''' (around, about) < '''[[*umbi]]''' < Proto-Indo-European '''[[*ambhi]]''' (around).
:*'''[[Cause]]''' < Middle English < from Latin '''[[causa#Latin|causa]]''' (a cause, a reason, motive, pretext, a case at law, lawsuit, claim), of unknown origin.

===Conjunction===
'''because'''
#By or for the cause that; on this account that; for the reason that.
#:''I hid myself '''because''' I was afraid.''

====Synonyms====
*[[therefore]]
*[[since]] (''note'' : this word, contrary to because, has several meanings) 
*[[for]] (''note'' : this word, contrary to because, has several meanings) 
*[[as]]
*[[inasmuch as]]

====Usage note====
These particles are used, in certain connections, to assign the reason of a thing, or that on account of, which it is or takes place.  Because (by cause) is the strongest and most emphatic; as, I hid myself because I was afraid.  For is not quite so strong; as, in Shakespeare, ''I hate him, for he is a Christian.''  Since is less formal and more incidental than because; as, ''I will do it since you request me.''  It more commonly begins a sentence; as, ''Since your decision is made, I will say no more.''  As is still more incidental than since, and points to some existing fact by way of assigning a reason. Thus we say, ''as I knew him to be out of town, I did not call.'' Inasmuch as seems to carry with it a kind of qualification which does not belong to the rest.  Thus, if we say, ''I am ready to accept your proposal, inasmuch as I believe it is the best you can offer,'' we mean, it is only with this understanding that we can accept it.
<!--Webster 1913-->
