The term "gafiate" is a science fiction and fantasy [[Fandom]] [[jargon]] term meaning to drop out of SF related community activities, with the implication to [[Get A Life]]. The word is derived via the [[acronym]] for "Get Away From It All". The term has spread to members of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] and [[Renaissance Fair]] participants, due to the social and contextual intersection between the communities.
