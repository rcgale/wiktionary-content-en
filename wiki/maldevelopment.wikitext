The '''maldeveloment''' referes to a being or an organisation that did not develop in the "normal" way (used in medicine, e.g. "brain maldeveloment of a fetus"). It was introduced for the human and social development in [[France]] in the [[1990's]] to replace the word "[[underdevelopment]]". The word ''maldéveloppement'' did not exist since then (the medical term is ''malformation'' or ''développement anormal''), so the word is a [[neologism]] built with the analogy between [[undernutrition]] and [[malnutrition]].

The maldevelopment is a global concept that includes the human and social development. The economical development is only a "tool" that allows the human and the social development, not the final goal.

The ''under''-development is a quantitative notion, implying that a nation has a lack and must gain something to reach a reference state; the reference state is the state of the nation that judges a nation as underdevelopped, so this notion also implies a unique develoment model, the one of the judging nation.

The ''mal''-development, or ''ill''-development, is a qualitative notion, that expresses a mismatch, a discrepancy between the conditions (economical, political, meteorological, cultural... conditions) and the needs and means of the people.
