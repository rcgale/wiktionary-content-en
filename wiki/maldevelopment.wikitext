The '''maldevelopment''' is a word invented in [[France]] in the [[1990's]] to replace the word "[[underdevelopment]]". It is built with the analogy between [[undernutrition]] and [[malnutrition]].

The maldevelopment is a global concept that includes the human and social development. The economical development is only a "tool" that allows the human and the social development, not the final goal.
