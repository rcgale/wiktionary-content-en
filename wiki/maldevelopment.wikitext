The '''maldevelopment''' is a word invented in [[France]] in the [[1990's]] to replace the word "[[underdevelopment]]". It is built with the analogy between [[undernutrition]] and [[malnutrition]].

The maldevelopment is a global concept that includes the human and social development. The economical development is only a "tool" that allows the human and the social development, not the final goal.

The ''under''-development is a quantitative notion, implying that a nation has a lack and must gain something to reach a reference state; the reference state is the state of the judging nation, so this notion also implies a unique develoment model.

The ''mal''-development, or ''ill''-development, is a qualitative notion, that expresses a missmatch, a discrepancy between the conditions (economical, political, meteorological... conditions) and the needs and means of the people.
