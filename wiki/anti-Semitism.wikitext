'''Anti-Semitism''' is either: 
 
* Hostility toward [[Jew]]s resulting from no legitimate cause or in a degree that greatly exceeds any legitimate greivances    
* Disdain for supposed physical or moral features of Jews, whether baseless, exaggerrated, or rooted in excessive generalization.

Anti-semitism, in a nutshell, is racism against Jews. Racism is often unlcear, however, and anti-semitism often takes anti-ethnic forms, as well as anti-religious forms, as well; often all of these are used interchangable, and, some critics say, is often a word thats purpose is to derisively scapegoat people for voicing opinions which are contradictory to mainstream Jewish opinion. This is the core debate between whether someone is an anti-Semite (racism) or an anti-Zionist (politically opposed to Zionism). Once again, these are not the same, despite the fact that Anti-Zionists may often exhibit anti-semitism.

* Hostility towards Jews as a religious or racial minority group often accompanied by social, economic, and political discrimination (Webster's Third New International Dictionary) 
* "The attributing of all or part of one's own misfortunes,and those of one's country, to the presence of Jewish elements in the community, and proposing to remedying this state of affairs by depriving the Jews of certain of their rights; by keeping them out of certain economic or social activities, by expelling them from the country,by exterminating them etc. (Jean Paul Sartre, "Anti-Semite and Jew") 
* "Attitudes and actions against Jews based on the belief that they are uniquely inferior, evil, or deserving of co ndemnation by their very nature, or by historical or supernatural dictates. ("Anti-Semitism: The Causes and Effects Of A Prejudice", Crosser & Halperin) 
* "The hatred and persecution of Jews as a group; not the hatred of persons who happen to be Jews, but rather the hatred of persons because they are Jews" (Charles Glock and Rodney Stark, "Christian Beliefs & Anti -Semitism")
