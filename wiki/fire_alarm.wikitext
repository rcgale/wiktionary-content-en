=== Noun ===
'''[[fire]] [[alarm]]'''
# A [[device]] used to alert the [[occupant]]s of a [[structure]] to the presence of [[smoke]] or [[heat]].  Types include [[smoke detector]]s and comprehensive automatic alarms.  Some automatic fire alarms are linked to [[sprinkler system]]s.  Most sprinkler systems consist of a glass insulator filled with liquid; when liquid becomes hot, it breaks the glass, releasing the sprinkler mechanism.
