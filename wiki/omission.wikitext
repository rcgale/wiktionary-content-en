===Etymology===
Originally from Latin, ''omittere'' (literally 'to send'). Post-classical Latin introduced the term ''omission''; from the past participial stem of omittere, '''omiss-''' and the suffix [[ion]]. This word was taken into Middle French and subsequently [[Anglo-Norman]] which heavily influenced the English language.

====Quotations====
*S'pose people left money laying around where he was&mdash;what did he do?  He collared it.  S'pose he contracted to do a thing; and you paid him, and didn't set down there and see that he done it&mdash;what did he do?  He always done the other thing.  S'pose he opened his mouth&mdash;what then?  If he didn't shut it up powerful quick, he'd lose a lie, every time.  That's the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we'd 'a' had him along 'stead of our kings, he'd 'a' fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done.
*:&mdash;Mark Twain, ''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn''
