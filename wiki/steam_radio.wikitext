Steam radio is a phrase of British slang for both the apparatus and the content of the communications medium of [[broadcasting|broadcast]] radio prior to the portable [[transistor radio]] and its catering to the youth market starting in the late 1950s. 

1.) Prior to the transistor age, a [[receiver]] apparatus was large and filled with [[thermionic valve]]s ([[electronic tube]]s) that would fail and could be replaced; these parts were incomprehensible to most people and their supersession reminded them of the passing of steam locomotives. 

2.) Radio drama and comedy for the whole family are genres that have disappeared, as well as the [[popular music]] before [[rock and roll]]; these are included in another use of the term, along with changes in the style of [[newsreader]]s (radio announcers).
