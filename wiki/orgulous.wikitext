#:*  At that time there was a knight, the which was the king's son of Ireland, and his name was Lanceor, the which was an orgulous knight, and counted himself one of the best of the court; and he had great despite at Balin for the achieving of the sword, that any should be accounted more hardy, or of more prowess; and he asked King Arthur if he would give him leave to ride after Balin and to revenge the despite that he had done. &mdash; Sir Thomas Malory, ''Le Morte D'Arthur'', page 54 (Book II, Chapter IV).
