===Noun===
'''Attenuation''' 
#To lessen the amount, [[force]], [[magnitude]], or value of something.
#(''Biology'') A mechanism in the regulation of gene expression.
#(''Ecology, geochemistry'') The ability to withhold contaminants in soil and [[groundwater by various mechanisms like adsorption, dilution, dispersion or biological degradation, causing a decrease in concentration and toxicity compared to the total amount of the contaminant.
#(''Physical oceanography'') Light '''attenuation''' is the decrease in light intensity with depth in the water column due to absorption (by water molecules) and scattering (by [[turbidity|suspended particulates]]).
#(''Telecommunication''), The decrease in intensity of a [[signal]], beam, or wave as a result of [[absorption]] of energy and of scattering out of the path to the detector, but not including the reduction due to geometric spreading.  

:''Note 1:''  Attenuation is usually expressed in [[Bel|dB]]. 
:''Note 2:''  ''"Attenuation"'' is often used as a misnomer for "'''[[attenuation coefficient]],''' " which is expressed in dB per [[kilometer]]. 
:''Note 3:''  A distinction must be made as to whether the attenuation is that of signal [[power]] or signal electric [[field strength]].
