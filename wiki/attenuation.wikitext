'''Attenuation''' is to lessen the amount, [[force]], [[magnitude]], or value of something.

1. In [[biology]], '''attenuation''' is a mechanism in the regulation of [[gene expression]]

2. In [[ecology]] and [[geochemistry]], '''attenuation''' is the ability to withhold [[contaminant]]s in [[soil]] and [[groundwater]] by various mechanisms like [[adsorption]], [[dilution]], [[dispersion]] or biological [[degradation]], causing a decrease in [[concentration]] and [[toxicity]] compared to the total amount of the contaminant.

3. In [[physical oceanography]], light '''attenuation''' is the decrease in light [[intensity]] with depth in the water column due to absorption (by [[water]] molecules) and scattering (by [[turbidity|suspended particulates]]).

4. In [[telecommunication]], '''attenuation''' is the decrease in [[intensity]] of a [[signal]], [[beam]], or wave as a result of [[absorption]] of energy and of scattering out of the [[path]] to the [[detector]], but not including the reduction due to geometric spreading.  

:''Note 1:''  Attenuation is usually expressed in [[Bel|dB]]. 
:''Note 2:''  ''"Attenuation"'' is often used as a misnomer for "'''[[attenuation coefficient]],''' " which is expressed in dB per [[kilometer]]. 
:''Note 3:''  A distinction must be made as to whether the attenuation is that of signal [[power]] or signal electric [[field strength]].
