Also: '''fine-structure constant''

In physics, the Fine Structure Constant is equal to approximatly '''1/137.03599958''', and is a dimentionless combination of electrical charge of the electron, the Planck constant and the speed of light. The fine structure constant describes how electromagnetic forces hold atoms together and the way light interacts with atoms.

It is usually denoted with the greek letter &alpha; (alpha).
