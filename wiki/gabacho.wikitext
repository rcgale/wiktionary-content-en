The been brief edition of the "etimol�gico Dictionary of the Castilian language", of Joan Coromines says following on the voice "gabacho": "contemptuous Name that is applied to the French from 1530. Of the occitano "gavach", ` mountain groser�, ` person coming from a northern region and that speaks bad the language of pa�s'. The own sense of the word is ` crop of av� (century XIII) and ` boci�, applied to the mountain dwellers of the northern occitanas zones, by the frequency of this disease between such. Voice of not well emphasized preRoman origin." In the "Diccionari etimol�gic of llengua Catalan", Coromines mentions a series of Catalan voices that contain the root gav- and deduces that this can have a meaning similar to ` buch� or ` tip of av�. In occitano, the name designated to the mountain dwellers of the north of the country; in Catalan to the border occitanos; finally, in Castilian, it happened to designate to all the inhabitants of the French Republic. In 1992, nevertheless, we remembered to have seen one painted in an access road the city of Perpi��n (French Catalonia) that it proclaimed, in great characters, "SEM PAS GAVATXOS" (`no we are gabachos'). The word "gabacho" is also used nowadays in Mexico to talk about to the people and objects coming from the U.S.A..
