An '''open problem''' is a problem that can be formally stated and for which a solution is known to exist but which has not yet been solved. It is common in [[graduate school]]s to point out open problems to students in the hopes that perhaps the student can solve such problems.

Examples of formerly open problems that have been closed since [[1975]] include [[Fermat's last theorem]] and the [[Four color theorem]].  Unfortunately, these problems were solved by [[faculty]] members, not by graduate students. Important open problems exist in many fields, such as in the field of theoretical computer science, computer scheduling, and real-time computer.
