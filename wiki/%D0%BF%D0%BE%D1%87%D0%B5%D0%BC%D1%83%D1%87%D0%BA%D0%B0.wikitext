A '''pochemuchka''' (Russian: &#1087;&#1086;&#1095;&#1077;&#1084;&#1091;&#1095;&#1082;&#1072;) is a person, often a child, who asks a lot of questions.  The word was inspired by a well-known Russian children's book titled ''Alesha Pochemuchka'', which tells the story of a highly inquisitive five- or six-year-old boy.

The term ''pochemuchka'' has no single word equivalent in the English language.  The term gained currency in English after it was named in a [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] article as among the most difficult words (in any language) to translate.
