'''Fag hag''' is a slang term, either abusive or highly admiring, for a (usually straight) woman who likes to hang out with [[gay]] men. Gay men and [[fag (pejorative)|fag]] hags often share a very close friendship, sometimes even closer than they might have with other women or men. Some would say that fag hags are pitied based on the assumption that their fascination with gay men lies in infatuation, which will most likely never be consummated. However, many fag hag relationships contain no romantic feelings on the woman's part; indeed, many fag hags are [[lesbian]].

The term "fag hag" does not generally carry the same negative connotations that "[[fag (pejorative)|fag]]" would.  The term is used, without the intent to insult, by both gay men and their female admirers.  Some women (such as comedian [[Margaret Cho]]) will proudly declare themselves to be fag hags.

Synonyms include '''fruit fly''' and '''fairy godmother'''.

[[Judy Garland]] has been characterized as a fag hag.

[[Julia Roberts]]' character in ''[[The Mexican]]'' developed a fag hag-type relationship with a gay hit man, Winston Baldry, played by [[James Gandolfini]]. Other media examples include the show [[Will & Grace]] and the film ''[[The Object of My Affection]]''.

The slang terms '''dyke tyke''' or '''Dutch boy''' have been used occasionally to refer to a [[male]] with extensive [[platonic]] [[friendship]]s with lesbians, but this usage is far less common.

A straight man who has a similiar affinity with gay men is termed a '''fag-stag''', but, again, this usage (and, indeed, occurance) is rare.
