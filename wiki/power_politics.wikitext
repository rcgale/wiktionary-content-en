'''Power politics''' is a state of [[international relations]] in which [[sovereignty|sovereign]]s protect their own interests by threatening one another with military, economic, or political aggression.  Power politics is basically a way of seeing the world of international relations: nations compete for the world's resources and it is to a nation's advantage to be manifestly able to harm others.  It prioritizes national self-interest over the interest of other nations or the [[international community]].  

Techniques of power politics include, but are not limited to, conspicuous [[nuclear]] development, [[prÃ«emptive strike]], [[blackmail]], the massing of military units on a border, and the imposition of [[tariff]]s or [[economic sanctions]].
