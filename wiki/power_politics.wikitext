'''Power politics''' is a state of [[international relations]] in which [[sovereignty|sovereign]]s protect their own interests by threatening one another with [[military]], [[economic]], or [[political]] aggression. Power politics is basically a way of seeing the world of international relations: nations compete for the world's resources and it is to a nation's advantage to be manifestly able to harm others.  It prioritizes national self-interest over the interest of other nations or the [[international community]].  

Techniques of power politics include, but are not limited to, conspicuous [[nuclear warfare|nuclear]] development, [[preemptive strike]], [[blackmail]], the massing of military units on a border, the imposition of [[tariff]]s or [[economic sanction]]s, [[bait and bleed]] and bloodletting, [[balancing]], [[buck passing]], [[covert operation]]s, and [[asymmetric warfare]].

The English term 'power politics' is derived from the German word ''[[Machtpolitik]]''.
