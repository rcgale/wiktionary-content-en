A '''long drink''' is the classic reference to any drink containing more than 5 [[ounce]]s of liquid and less than 9 oz's. This [[terminology]] had fallen out of favor over the last decade or two, but is now enjoying a [[revival]]. Typically, a long drink will have lots of ice and [[mixer]], perfect for warmer days, as opposed to a [[short drink]].
