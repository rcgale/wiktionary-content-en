•  a state of higher awareness where that which is percieved is appreciated as being beyond all doubts real, actual, and significant. Where love and knowledge of things are united in a clear wisdom of appreciation. Nothing seems totally unimportant to a mind in a state of Gnosis… and nothing more totally important than to love the truths that are directly percievable, and to appreciate the certainty of the ultimate beauty of any such truths as are not.
