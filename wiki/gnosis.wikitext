===Noun===
#A state of higher awareness where that which is perceived is appreciated as being beyond all doubts real, actual, or significant. Where love and knowledge of things are united in a clear wisdom of appreciation. Nothing seems totally unimportant to a mind in a state of Gnosisâ€¦ and nothing more totally important than to love the truths that are directly perceivable, and to appreciate the certainty of the ultimate beauty of any such truths as are not.
