A '''ten foot pole''' is a [[metaphor]]ical object for keeping things at a distance, and thus something that you wouldn't touch with one is something that is best kept ''far'' away.

The original ten foot poles were the poles used by bargemen to push [[barge]]s and [[raft]]s around on [[river]]s and [[lake]]s.  Such poles were also quite useful for keeping things such as other barges, aggressive animals, and annoying people at bay.
