===Etymology===
*Dex - probably a corruption of [[deca]] or [[decade]] meaning ten.

=== Noun ===
'''dex'''
* [[Jargon]] term from [[physics]] and [[astrophysics]]. An order or factor of ten. When dealing with [[log]] to the base 10 transform of a number set the transform of 10, 100, and 1 000 000 is <math>\log_{10}(10) = 1</math>, <math>\log_{10}(100) = 2</math>, and <math>\log_{10}(1 000 000) = 6</math>, so the difference between 10 and 100 in base 10 is 1 dex and the difference between 10 and 1 000 000 is 6 dex.
