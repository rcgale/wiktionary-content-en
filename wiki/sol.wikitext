<b>sol</b> (<i>noun</i>)
# (<i>space exploration</I>) The &ldquo;day&rdquo; (cycle of light and darkness) on another planet, particularly Mars whose [[synodical]] rotation period is 24 hours, 39 minutes, 35 seconds.  This is only slightly longer than Earth&rsquo, so researchers who [[telecommute]] (operate instruments on) the surface of Mars adjust their workday to the Martian ''sol''.

# (<i>music</i>) The fifth step in the [[solfege]] scale, preceded by [[fa]] and followed by [[lah]].

# (<i>currency</i>) Main currency unit of [[Peru]]

:: <i>Three days after, the Great Sun, his brother, sent me another deer-skin of the same oil, to the quantity of forty pints. The commonest sort sold this year at twenty <b>sols</b> a pint, and I was sure mine was not of the worst kind.</i>
