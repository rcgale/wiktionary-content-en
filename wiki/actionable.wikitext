<BLOCKQUOTE>
&ldquo;It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but if you
are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is
you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing
<B>actionable</B> from the first, but as long as you keep that door
locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal
constraint.&rdquo;<BR>
&mdash;  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in ''A Case of Identity''
