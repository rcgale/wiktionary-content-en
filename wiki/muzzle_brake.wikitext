===Noun===
'''Muzzle brake'''
# '''Firearms Term'''. A device placed at the end of the [[bore]] of a [[rifle]], [[pistol]], or [[cannon]], which essentially trades gas energy for [[recoil]] energy. This increases [[muzzle blast]] by venting gases from the [[muzzle]] (usually in the direction of the ground or opposite the direction of fire, but sometimes also in the direction of the user), countering the [[force]] of the [[projectile]] leaving the [[weapon]].
