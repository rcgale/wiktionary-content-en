'''Sat Sri Akaal''' a [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] greeting.  It means roughly, "He/She Be Blessed Who says Truth is God".  In Punjabi the greeting one uses is tied directly to the religion of the one being greeted and Sat Sri Akaal is used only to greet [[Sikhs]].  The proper greetings for [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]] are [[Namaste]] and [[Salaam Alikum]] respectively.  If one does not know the religion of the person they are greeting, it is suggested that the neutral greetings [[hello]] or [[hi]] (both being emulated from [[English language|English]]) be used.
