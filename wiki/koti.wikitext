==Finnish==
([[Wiktionary:Finnish_index_k|index K]])

===Etymology===

Became "independent" from the case forms of ''[[kota#Finnish|kota]]'' "wigwam-like tent": In plural, one could say eg. in the [[illative]] ''Menen kotiin'', "I'll go to the tents"&mdash;there were many tents in a typical ancient settlement. The form was then reanalyzed as ''koti'' + ''-in'' and developed new plural forms, eg. the partitive: ''koteja''.

===Noun===

# [[home]].

[[io:Koti]]
