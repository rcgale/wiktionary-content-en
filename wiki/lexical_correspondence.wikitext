A '''lexical correspondence''' is a set of [[cognate]]
words or [[morpheme]]s in two or more related languages.
In order to form such a correspondence, it is not
sufficient that the words are similar in both form
and meaning, but that regular [[sound correspondence]]s
occur between the [[phoneme]]s contained in the words.
