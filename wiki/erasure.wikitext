====Quotations====
'''total blankness'''
*'''2004''': Bush, even when he had the floor, grimaced as he spoke, except on several occasions when he lost his way and a look of total '''erasure''' came over him, a blank, stricken stare for which the French, alas, have the most apt expression: like a cow watching a train go by. &mdash; ''The New Yorker,'' 18 Oct 2004
