====Quotations====
<blockquote>
Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe.  &ldquo;No doubt you think
that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,&rdquo;
he observed.  &ldquo;Now, in my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior
fellow.  That trick of his of breaking in on his friends'
thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour's
silence is really very showy and superficial.  He had some
analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such
a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.&rdquo;<BR>
&mdash;Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in ''A Study in Scarlet''
