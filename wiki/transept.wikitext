'''transept''' (''plural'' '''transepts''')

#The [[transversal]] part of a church, which crosses at [[right angle]]s to the greatest length, and between the [[nave]] and [[choir]]. In the [[basilica]]s, this had often no projection at its two ends. In [[Gothic]] churches these project greatly, and should be called the arms of the transept. It is common, however, to speak of the arms themselves as the transepts.
