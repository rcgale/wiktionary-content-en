''For another use of the term "anaclitism", see [[anaclitic depression]]''

In the field of [[sexology]], '''anaclitism''' involves deriving adult [[sexual arousal]] from objects that one was exposed to as an infant. The [[fetish]] value often stems from tactile stimulation similar to that experienced by the infant before it could see well.

Anaclitism is closely related to the phenomenon of [[infantilism]], also known by the terms [[adult baby]]ism and [[autonepiophilia]].
