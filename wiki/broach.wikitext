A broach is a series of chisel points mounted on one piece of steel. A broach is typically used to enlarge a circular hole into a larger noncircular shape such as a square or other desired shape. Another typical use of a broach is to cut a square keyway on objects such as gears, pulleys etc. A broach might be designed to be pushed through an existing hole, or, alternatively to be pulled through the hole. Broaching machines are designed to either push or pull a broach.

An unrelated use of the term broach is to denote an article of jewelry, typically worn on the upper body.
