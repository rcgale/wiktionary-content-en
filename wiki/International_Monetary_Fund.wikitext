'''IMF (International Monetary Fund)'''


Founded in 1944 as an entity related to the World Bank, the IMF was primarily designed to assist and stabilize the international monetary system and maintain the fixed exchange rates that were established after World War 11.

Since the fixed exchange rates began dissolving in the eearly 1970's, the IMF has evolved gradually into a lender of the last resot for governments that are in need of being baled out from dire financial straits. While the IMF imposes its conditions on such governments which include control over govt spending etc, and other measures that are designed to impose stability at macro-economic levels, a major accusation levelled against the IMF remains that its conditions are largely unrealistic.
