#Self-governing.  Governing [[independently]].
#Acting on one's own.  Acting independently.  Acting without being governed by parental or guardian rules.
#In the grammar of [[Celtic]] languages: (of a verb form) used with no subject, indicating an unknown or unspecified agent; used in similar situations as the [[passive]] in English (the difference being that the theme in the English passive construction is the [[subject]], while in the Celtic autonomous construction the theme is the [[object]] and there is no subject).
