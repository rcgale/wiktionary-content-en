==Etymology==
Borrowed from French, pere meaning ''father'', which at its root has a Latin word, ''pater'' with the same meaning. Current usage of differentiating fathers and sons is borrowed entirely from French, as such term follows the name in convention with French grammar. 

==Adjective==
Term follows a proper name and is used to differentiate between a father and son with the same name.  
''ex. Bush pere, Bush fils.'' 

==Noun==
Can be used in context to refer to the father without mentioning the name. This is not used too often.
''ex. Where Bush fils is easy going and informal, Pere is more deliberate and formal.''
