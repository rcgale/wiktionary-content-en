===Etymology===
Borrowed from French, [[p√®re]] meaning ''[[father]]'', which at its root has a Latin word, ''[[pater]]'' with the same meaning. Current usage of differentiating fathers and sons is borrowed entirely from French, as such term follows the name in convention with French grammar. 

===Adjective===
Term follows a proper name and is used to differentiate between a father and son with the same name.  

===Noun===
Can be used in context to refer to the father without mentioning the name. This is not used too often.
