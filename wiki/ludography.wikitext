A '''ludography''' is a list of [[game]]s designed by a [[game designer]], either an individual or entity. This term could be considered [[jargon]], likely originating from the British [[dice]] and [[board game]] [[Ludo (game)|Ludo]], or from the [[Latin]] word ''ludus'' (game).

The earliest use of the term that has been found (as of [[2004]]) is from the April 1998 issue of Simulacrum magazine, the Quarterly Journal of Board Wargame Collecting. A scanned image of that cover can be found [http://www3.telus.net/Simulacrum/graphics/cover1.gif here].
