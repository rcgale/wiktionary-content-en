#:*'''1786''': The [[pavais]], [[pavache]], or [[tallevas]] was a large shield, or rather a portable [[mantlet]], capable  of covering a man from head to foot, and probably of sufficient [[thickness]] to [[resist]] the [[missive]] [[weapon]]s then in use. &mdash; Francis Grose, ''A Treatise on Ancient Armour and Weapons'', page 27.
