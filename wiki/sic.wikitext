== [[adverb]] ==

Sic is used to indicate a previous phrase or word was either intentionally written wrong or quoted exactly (and thus faulty) as it was in the source from which it was quoted. 

=== [[Example]] === 
If there would be software package for checking the spelling of URL's sent to the Apache webserver, a manual could refer to it as "mod_speling (sic)". (There actually is such a module.)
