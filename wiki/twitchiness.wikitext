====Quotations====
*'''2004''': The President held his head slightly cocked and low to his shoulders, and his expressions kept shifting, in increments of wincing aggravation—lips drawn tight and downward, nostrils flaring and flattening, eyebrows wriggling—through a range of attitudes: impatience, boredom, indignation, sourness, imperiousness, contempt. This unhappy '''twitchiness''' persisted through the evening. &mdash; ''The New Yorker,'' 18 Oct 2004
