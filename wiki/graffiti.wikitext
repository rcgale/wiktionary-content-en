==English==
===Etymology===
Italian plural of ''[[graffito]]'', "scratched"

===Noun===
'''graffiti''' (uncountable; plural); singular: '''[[graffito]]''' or '''graffiti'''.

#[[Inscription]]s, figure drawings, etc., found on the walls of ancient [[sepulchers]] or ruins, as in the [[Catacomb]]s, or at [[Pompeii]].
#A form of [[vandalism]] involving written language.

===Usage note===

The singular ''graffito'' is preferred for the sense of ''inscriptions''.

Either the invariant singular ''graffiti'' may also be heard in the context of vandalism/art.  It appears difficult to determine the relative frequency of the two forms in this case, as the singular is rarely used in this context.
