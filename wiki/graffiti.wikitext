===Noun===
'''graffiti''' (uncountable; plural); singular: '''[[graffito]]''' or '''graffiti'''.

===Usage note===

The singular ''graffito'' is preferred for the sense of ''inscriptions''.

Either ''graffito'' or the invariant singular ''graffiti'' may be heard in the context of vandalism/art.  It appears difficult to determine the relative frequency of the two forms in this case, as the singular is rarely used in this context.
