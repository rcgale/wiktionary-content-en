===Usage notes===
*The singular ''graffito'' is preferred for the sense of ''inscriptions''.
*Either ''graffito'' or the uncountable ''graffiti'' may be heard in the context of vandalism/art.  It appears difficult to determine the relative frequency of the two forms in this case, as the singular is rarely used in this context.
