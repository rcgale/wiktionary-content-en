'''[[cosmic]] [[ray]]'''
{{wikipedia}}


# an [[energetic]] [[particle]] originating outside our [[solar system]]. 
# cosmic radiation: a stream of cosmic rays

The use of the words "[[ray]]" and "[[radiation]]" implies incorrectly that cosmic rays are [[electromagnetic wave]]s, similar to [[light]] rays and [[X-rays]]; cosmic rays were so named before their nature was known.
