'''Ka-tzetnik''' was short for 'concentration camp designate' (or inmate) to refer to Jews imprisoned in camps during the [[Holocaust]]. It was followed by a number, and this designation was [[tattoo|tatooed]] on the forearm of Jews processed into the camps.

Some survivors today still bear the mark, ''(written K.T.000000)'', and one survivor, writer-hisrotrian [[Yehiel Dinur]], (Also Nina De-Nur), wrote his books the pen name Ka-Tzetnik 135633, documenting the history of Nazi [[atrocities]].
