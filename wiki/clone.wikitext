===Etymology===
The term '''''[[clone]]''''' is derived from ''kl&#333;n'', the [[Wikipedia:Greek language|Greek]] word for "twig".
In [[Wikipedia:horticulture|horticulture]], the spelling ''clon'' was used until the twentieth century.
The final ''e'' came into use to indicate the vowel is a "long o" instead of a "short o";
see the references below on this point.
Since the term entered the popular lexicon in a more general context,
the spelling ''clone'' has been used exclusively.
