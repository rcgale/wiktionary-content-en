'''bells'''  (or ''ship's bells'')
#(''nautical'') The [[stroke]]s on a [[ship]]'s [[bell]], every [[half hour]], to [[mark]] the [[passage]] of [[time]] on board ship. In each of the day's six [[watch]]es of four [[hour]]s, one bell marks the end of the first half hour, eight bells marks the end of the watch (the watch between 16:00 and 20:00 is divided into two [[dog watch]]es so as to produce an odd number of watches in the day - to aid crew rotation).
#The ordinary plural of bell.
