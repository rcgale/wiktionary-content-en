===Noun===
# A [[tool]] to turn screws. The difference between a normal screwdriver and a Phillips screwdriver is the blade. A normal screwdriver has a simple straight blade, a Phillips has a cross-like blade, thereby fitting into the opening at the top of specific screws which are compatible.  The advantages of Phillips screwdrivers is that they are easy to use on screws of different sizes.
