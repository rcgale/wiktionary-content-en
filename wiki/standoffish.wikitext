=== Adjective ===
=='''standoff[-]ish ''[ [[informal]], [[colloquial]] ]'''''==

Often used to describe the [[mannerism]]s expressed during the engagement of a "stand[-]off"; that is, [[behaviour]] deemed as possibly [[irrational]], [[hostile]], [[uptight]] and/or [[harsh]], exhibited in moments of [[social]] [[conflict]] or general personal [[agitation]]/[[stress]].

''(Refer to the informal suffix &ldquo;[[-ish]]&rdquo;, which in this context merely seems to indicate the colloquial derivation from the original noun, or verb.)''

Examples:

<ul>
<li>''There were two people involved in a [[standoff]] outside the dormitory.''</li>
<li>
<ul><li>''&ldquo;The former friends were behaving in a ''standoff-ish'' manner towards each other.&rdquo;''</li></ul>
</li>
<li>''Sarah Gaywood was behaving in a ''standoff-ish'' manner.''</li>

May appear hyphenated or otherwise, depending on individual discretion. (''stand-off, [[standoff]], standoff-ish'' etc.)
