'''Than''' is a [[w:grammatical particle|grammatical particle]] and [[w:preposition|preposition]] in the [[w:English language|English language]].  It  introduces a comparison, and as such is associated with [[w:comparative|comparative]]s, and with words such as ''[[more]]'', ''[[less]]'', and ''[[fewer]]''.  Typically, it seeks to measure the force of an [[w:adjective|adjective]] or similar description between two [[w:predicate|predicate]]s.

== Etymology ==

In [[w:etymology|etymology]], it represents [[w:Old English language|Old English]] ''[[&thorn;anne]]'', which was a variant of ''[[&thorn;onne]]'', meaning "[[then]]".  It is therefore [[w:cognate|cognate]] with [[w:German language|German]] ''[[denn]]'', "than," and ''dann'', "then;" in [[w:Danish language|Danish]] the same word ''[[dan]]'' serves for both "then" and "than."  It represents the old [[w:dative case|dative]] or [[w:instrumental case|instrumental case]] of the pronoun ''[[that]]''.    

== Usage ==

[[w:Prescription (linguistics)|Usage prescriptionists]] have ordained a number of rules concerning ''than'' that those who do not wish to be edited or corrected may wish to note.  These prescriptive grammarians deny that ''than'' is a preposition that invariably governs the [[w:oblique case|oblique case]], although it has been used as such by writers such as [[w:William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]], whose [[w:1600|1600]] play ''[[w:Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar|]]'' contains the line:

:''A man no mightier than thyself or me. . .''

and [[en:Samuel Johnson]], who wrote:

:''No man had ever more discernment than him, in finding out the ridiculous.''

In actual usage, then, ''than'' functions as both conjunction and preposition; when it is used as a conjunction, it governs the [[w:nominative case|nominative case]], and when a preoposition, the oblique case.  This rule, while describing the usage of the word in [[w:modern English|modern English]], is thought insufficiently rigid by some, and deprives those who enjoy correcting their neighbours of a source of mostly innocent fun.  So the prescriptionist rules have not been allowed to entirely lapse.

To determine the [[en:noun case|case]] of a [[en:pronoun|pronoun]] following "than" observing the prescriptionists' rules, a writer must look for extra understood words and determine how they relate to the pronoun.

Examples:

* ''You are a better swimmer than she.''
** represents ''You are a better swimmer than she is.''

therefore ''You are a better swimmer than her'' is a [[en:solecism]].

* ''They like you more than her.''
** represents ''They like you more than they like her.''

therefore ''They like you more than she'' is a solecism.
