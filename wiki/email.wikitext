==== Usage note ====
===== e-mail vs. email =====
The spellings ''email'' and ''e-mail'' are both in common use.  The former sees somewhat more frequent use<!-- help me back this up? -->, though it is sometimes prescribed against.  In general, the latter is more likely to be considered the correct form.

===== email vs. emails =====
As a contraction of ''[[electronic mail]]'', some feel that ''email'' should follow the same pluralization rules and be uncountable, prohibiting the forms ''emails'' and ''an email''.  Others feel that it is not necessary for ''email'' to maintain grammatical similarity to ''mail'', and prefer to pluralize the term as a countable noun.  This issue is hotly debated, but it is seldom considered incorrect to use the uncountable form.
