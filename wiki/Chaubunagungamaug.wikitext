 A Native American lake name meaning "you fish on your side, I fish on my side an no one fishes in the middle" 

Notes: 
The official name of a lake in Webster, Massachusetts. The Nipmucks and other tribes gave it a variety of similar names. Many residents of Webster call it Webster Lake, because they can't pronounce the Nipmuck name, but others take pride in reeling off the Nipmuck version.

The name means approximately "Englishmen at Manchaug at the Fishing Place at the Boundary". Manchaug was the name of one of the tribes that lived by the shore of the lake, which was known before the Englishmen came as Chaubunagungamaugg, or "fishing place at the boundary". The lake was a noted fishing spot on the boundary of several tribes' territories, and for that reason was also used as a meeting place.
