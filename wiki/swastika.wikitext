===Etymology===
From Sanskrit ''[[स्वस्ितक]]'' (svastika), a lucky or auspicious object; a mark made on persons and things to denote good luck, from ''su-'' (cognate with Greek ''[[ευ-]]''), good, well, ''asti'', a verbal abstract to the root as '''to [[be]]''' &mdash; ''svasti'' thus means "well-being" &mdash; and the diminutive suffix ''-ka'' ; hence "little thing associated with well-being", corresponding roughly to "lucky charm".  The word first appears in the Classical Sanskrit (in the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics).

===Noun===
'''swastika''' (''plural'' '''swastikas''')

#A [[cross]] with arms of equal length all bent halfway along at a 90° angle to the right or to the left, used as a religious symbol by various ancient and modern civilisations, and adopted more recently (with arms angled to the right) as a symbol of [[Nazism]] and [[fascism]].
