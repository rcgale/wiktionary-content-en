A '''dudeen''' (from Old Irish and Celtic ''dudenus'') is a short stemmed [[Irish]] [[pipe]]. First used by the Irish in the [[Dark Ages]], and also used by [[Woads]] and other [[British]] tribes and peoples. Then later used as a presentation gift with a eagle to the Dons. Don Vmo gave Rar, Oxford, and Mel the first Don Dudeens, then to two more. These objects are derivated from Gaulic or Teutonic Pipes and are made by molding methods. Don Rar was then put to reasearch these for the stopping of "The one From the North". Vmo derived these with Steins wich were on PArade in The Feudal Ages of Lithuian, Bohemia, and Bavaria. Then the dudeen was smoked with stoogies ( see.botany/stugious/{old German})
