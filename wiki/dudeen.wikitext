A '''dudeen''' (from Old Irish and Celtic ''dudenus'') is a short stemmed [[Irish]] [[pipe]]. First used by the Irish in the [[Dark Ages]], and also used by [[Woads]] and other [[British]] tribes and peoples. Then later used as a presentation gift with a eagle to the Dons. Don Vmo gave Rar, Oxford, and Mel the first Don Dudeens, then to two more. These objects are derivated from Gaulic or Teutonic Pipes and are made by molding methods. Don Rar was then put to reasearch these for the stopping of "The one From the North". Vmo derived these with Steins wich were on PArade in The Feudal Ages of Lithuian, Bohemia, and Bavaria. Then the dudeen was smoked with stoogies ( see.botany/stugious/{old German})

Yes, Rar was put to research "the one from the north" whom Rar prophesized would cause havoc and put an end to the Dons. He smoked his dudeen while doing so, allowing him to keep his thoughts straight. The Dons entered war with "The Dark Siders" but they were victorious. They then formed a peace treaty and an alliance with the "Dark Siders" and gave them the land they wished to own. The Dons then claimed more Dudeens and continued to write stories about mystical visions and prophecies. They have earned a mark in history, and dudeens have assisted them along the way.
