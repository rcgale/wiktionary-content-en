A '''dudeen''' (from Old Irish and Celtic ''dudenus'') is a short stemmed [[Irish]] [[pipe]]. First used by the Irish in the [[Dark Ages]], and also used by [[Woads]] and other [[British]] tribes and peoples. Then later used as a presentation gift with a eagle to the Dons. Don Vmo gave Rar, Oxford, and Mel the first Don Dudeens, then to two more. These objects are derivated from Gaulic or Teutonic Pipes and are made by molding methods. The cap is made of clay along with body. Much used in the Dark Ages.
