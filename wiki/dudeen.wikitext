== Dudeen (Dudenus-Old Irish and Celtic) ==


A short stemed Irish pipe. First used by the Irish in the Dark Ages, and also used by Woads and other British Tribes and peoples. Then later used as a presentation gift with a eagle to the Dons. Don Vmo gave Rar, Oford, and MEll the first Don Dudeens, then to two more. These objects are derivated from Gaulic or Teutonic Pipes. MAde by molding methods.
