'''C-command''' is a relationship in grammatical [[parse tree]]s which is similar to the idea of "siblings and all their descendents" in family trees.

In the following tree:
* A c-commands C, D, and E.
* B does not c-command any nodes.
* C c-commands A.
* D c-commands E.
* E c-commands D.

<pre>
   B
  / \
 A   C
    / \
   D   E
</pre>

A node is said to "dominate" another node if it is above it in the tree (it is a parent, grandparent, etc.) The formal definition is that X '''c-commands''' Y if:
* X does not dominate Y.
* Y does not dominate X.
* The first branching node that dominates X also dominates Y.

The branching requirement means that in the following tree, A c-commands D, E, and F.

<pre>
   C
  / \
 B   D
 |   |\
 A   E F
</pre>
