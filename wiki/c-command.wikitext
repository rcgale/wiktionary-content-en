'''C-command''' is a relationship in grammatical [[parse tree]]s which is equivalent to the idea of "cousins and all their descendents" in family trees.

In the following tree, A '''c-commands''' C, D, and E.

<pre>
   B
  / \
 A   C
    / \
   D   E
</pre>

The formal definition is that X '''c-commands''' Y if the first parent of X contains Y.
