[[light]] + [[year]]

===Noun===
'''light year'''

#(''astronomy'') A unit of [[length]] (''abbreviation'' ly) equal to the distance [[light]] travels in one [[year]]; used to measure extremely large distances.

#(''figurative, informal, non-standard'') A very long time
#:''Some of Leonardo da Vinci's inventions were light years ahead of its time.''

====Usage note====
*The light year is a unit of length, but because it contains the word ''year'' is sometimes assumed to be a unit of time.  Its use in the figurative sense of "a very long time" is non-standard; it is preferrable to an alternative term in this case.
