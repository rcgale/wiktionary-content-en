'''Darom''' ([[Standard Hebrew]] '''&#1491;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;''') is a word in [[Hebrew language]] that means "[[South]]". 

In [[Biblical Hebrew]] the name of the southern direction was '''Negba''' after the [[Negev]] [[desert]] in the south of [[Israel]]. Its [[etymology]] is derived from joining of two words: dar-rom &#1491;&#1512;-&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, which literally means "dwells in the peak of height". This is because the [[sun]] reaches the top in the noon when it is the southern direction.

"Ha-Darom" &#1492;&#1491;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; is a term used by [[Hebrew]] speaking people in [[Israel]] to call the southern parts of the country - the [[Negev]] and the [[Arava]].
