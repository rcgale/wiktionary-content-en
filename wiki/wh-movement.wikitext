'''Wh-movement''' is a [[linguistic]] phenomenon that involves the movement of [[interrogative pronoun]]s (also called ''wh-words'') to the beginning of an [[interrogative sentence]].  It is so called because most English interrogative pronouns start with ''wh-'', such as ''what'', ''where'', ''why'', etc.  Not all [[language]]s feature wh-movement, and those that do not are referred to as '''wh-in-situ''' languages.

English is one language that features wh-movement.  For example, a [[declarative sentence]] in English featuring normal [[word order]] would be:
: He buys bread.
The [[direct object]], "bread," of the verb, "to buy," normally follows the verb, however, when the direct object is replaced with a wh-word, the wh-word is generally moved to the beginning of the sentence:
: What does he buy?
In English, an insertion rule also causes the insertion of the verb "to do" after the wh-word.  When wh-movement occurs, linguists generally consider a silent ''trace'' (often indicated by a ''t'') to be left behind for the purposes of [[syntactic]] analysis:
: What does he buy ''t''?
