'''Wh-movement''' is a [[linguistic]] phenomenon that involves the movement of [[interrogative pronoun]]s (also called ''wh-words'') to the beginning of an [[interrogative sentence]].  It is so called because most English interrogative pronouns start with ''wh-'', such as ''what'', ''where'', ''why'', etc.  Not all [[language]]s feature wh-movement, and those that do not are referred to as '''wh-in-situ''' languages.

English is one language that features wh-movement.  For example, a [[declarative sentence]] in English featuring normal [[word order]] would be:
: He buys bread.
The [[direct object]], "bread," of the [[verb]], "to buy," normally follows the verb, however, when the direct object is replaced with a wh-word, the wh-word is generally moved to the beginning of the sentence:
: What does he buy?
In English, an insertion rule also causes the insertion of the verb "to do" after the wh-word.  When wh-movement occurs, linguists generally consider a silent ''trace'' (often indicated by a ''t'') to be left behind for the purposes of [[syntactic]] analysis:
: What does he buy ''t''?

==Pied-piping==
'''Pied-piping''' is a process that occurs when wh-movement applies to an entire phrase.  In the case where the wh-word refers to a [[determiner]], wh-movement can apply to an entire phrase.  For instance, in the following example, the entire phrase "what car" is moved:
: What car does he like ''t''?

In the case of determiners, pied-piping is obligatory.  For instance, the following sentence would be incorrect:
: *What does he like ''t'' car?

However, there are cases where pied-piping is optional.  In English, this is often the case when a wh-phrase are the object of a [[preposition]].  For instance, the following two examples are both correct:
# To where shall we travel ''t''?
# Where shall we travel to ''t''?
The second example is a case of '''preposition stranding''', which is possible in English, but not allowed in [[Latin]] or other [[Romance languages]].  For languages that use [[postposition]]s rather than prepositions, stranding is not allowed either.

[[Prescriptive]] grammarians often claim that preposition stranding should be avoided in Egnlish as well, however in certain contexts, obligatory pied-piping of prepositions in English may make a sentence feel artificial or stilted.
