'''appoggiatura'''

===Etymology===
Borrowed from Italian ''appoggiatura'', derived from ''appoggiare'', meaning "to lean."

#A melodically important musical ornament, sounded on the beat, preceding a main note (which it is one scale-step higher or lower than) and normally subtracting for itself half of the time value of that main note; written as a note of smaller size like the [[acciaccatura]], but without the semi-oblique stroke.
#:'''quotations''':
#:*"The following Adagietto was like a long, melting '''appoggiatura''' composed of smaller dying falls and languid resolutions." &mdash; ''New York Times'', March 2, 1992
