====Usage notes====
#Final ''y'' becomes ''i'' when this suffix is added ('''easy''', '''easier'''; '''worry''', '''worrier''').
#This suffix may be used to form the comparative of:
#:*adjectives and adverbs that have one syllable('''hot''', '''hotter'''; '''fast''', '''faster''');
#:*some, but not all, adjectives that have two syllables ('''funny''', '''funnier''').
#Most longer adjectives, and adjectives that are participles, form the comparative using '''more''' ('''enormous''', '''more enormous'''; '''burnt''', '''more burnt'''; '''freezing''', '''more freezing''').
#If in doubt, use '''more''' instead ('''thirsty''' may become '''thirstier''' but '''more thirsty''' would also be acceptable).
#The suffix may be used to form an agent noun of any verb.  In compound or phrasal verbs, the suffix usually follows the verb component (as in '''passerby''' and '''runner-up''') but is sometimes added at the end, irrespective of the position of the verb component ('''do-gooder''') or is added to both components for humorous effect ('''washer-upper''').
