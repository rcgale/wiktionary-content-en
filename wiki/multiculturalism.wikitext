'''multiculturalism''': meaningless slogan used (circa 2000) by the [http://www.ourcivilisation.com/pc.htm politically correct] to deny the obvious truth that different cultures are incompatible. They hide this assault upon truth with gibberish. e.g. 

"can mean either [[particularism]] or [[pluralism]]. In the sense of ''particularism'', it means breaking up a [[culture]] into separate subcultures which mix as little as possible. In the sense of pluralism, it means just the opposite: preventing the breakup of a culture by mixing the subcultures. Compare [[melting pot]]"
