'''multiculturalism''' can mean either [[particularism]] or [[pluralism]]. In the sense of ''particularism'', it means breaking up a culture into separate subcultures which mix as little as possible. In the sense of pluralism, it means just the opposite: preventing the breakup of a culture by mixing the subcultures. Compare [[melting pot]]
