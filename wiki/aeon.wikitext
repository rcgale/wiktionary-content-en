*'''1892''': When Earth's last picture is painted, and the tubes are twisted and dried,/ When the oldest colors have faded, and the youngest critic has died,/ We shall rest, and, faith, we shall need it -- lie down for an aeon or two,/Till the Master of All Good Workmen shall put us to work anew. &mdash; ''When Earth's Last Picture is Painted, l’Envoi to'' The Seven Seas, [[w:Rudyard Kipling|Rudyard Kipling]]
