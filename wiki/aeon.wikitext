A very long period of time. [See eon]

"When Earth's last picture is painted, 
and the tubes are twisted and dried,
When the oldest colors have faded, 
and the youngest critic has died,
We shall rest, and, faith, we shall need it -- 
lie down for an aeon or two,
Till the Master of All Good Workmen 
shall put us to work anew."

Kipling, "When Earth's Last Picture is Painted"
