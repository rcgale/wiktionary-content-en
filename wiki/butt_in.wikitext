To join a conversation or situation that does not belong to you. 

When people say: "Hey, this is none of your business, don't butt in!" it is usually used to express (at least) mild anger at the offending person and to insist that they no longer involve themselves in the conversation or situation. 

When someone who feels they need to interrupt a conversation to add to it they may say: "Forgive me for butting in but..." to excuse the interruption, and often remove the "rude" stigma sometimes applied to those who "butt in."
