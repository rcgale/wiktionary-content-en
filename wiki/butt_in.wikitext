To join a conversation or situation that does not belong to you. 

When people say: "Hey, this is none of your business, don't butt in!" it usually expresses (at least) mild anger at the offending person and to insist that they no longer involve themselves in the conversation or situation. 

One who feels they need to interrupt a conversation to add to it may say: "Forgive me for butting in but..." to excuse the interruption.
