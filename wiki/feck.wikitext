#Version of ''fuck'', considered more acceptable in company.

====Etymology====
As a swear word, it recently gained popularity following its frequent use in the 1990s comedy TV series [[w:Father Ted]] .  However it appears to be much older than that and may have originated from the Irish ''feic'' meaning to "look here".
