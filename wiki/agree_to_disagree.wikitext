To '''agree to disagree''' is used to describe remaining friendly while holding differing opinions.  As such, it is a misleading phrase: it would be better stated as ''recognizing that they disagree''.

There are some circumstances, such as in a [[democracy]], where a conscious decision to agree to disagree may be desirable, thus enabling important issues to be exposed to others who need to consider them for themselves.
