'''Daishi''' is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word which means great and/or silent death.  It was also used as an honorary title given by the Japanese Imperial Court.  The closest English translation for the word in this case would be "great teacher."  Two well known recipients are [[Kobo Daishi]] and [[Dengyo Daishi]], the founders of the Shingon and Tendai Buddhist sects, respectively.  

It has taken popularity from the game [[MechWarrior]].
