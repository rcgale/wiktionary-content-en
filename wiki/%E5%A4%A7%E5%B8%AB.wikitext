'''Daishi''' (&#22823;&#24107;) is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word which means great and/or silent master.  It was also used as an honorary title given by the Japanese Imperial Court.  The closest English translation for the word in this case would be "great teacher."  Two well known recipients are [[Kukai|K&#363;kai]] (or K&#333;b&#333; Daishi) and [[Saicho|Saich&#333;]] (or Dengy&#333; Daishi), the founders of the [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] and [[Tendai]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] sects, respectively.  

== Daishi in fiction ==

The [[BattleTech]] universe and its related [[MechWarrior]] game series have popularized the word ''Daishi'' as the Inner Sphere moniker for the ''Dire Wolf'' class OmniMech, albeit with the syllable ''shi'' in a different context, meaning "death" instead of "teacher."
