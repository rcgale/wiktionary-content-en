====Usage notes====
*All accent patterns in Japanese can be described either as 平板式 or as 起伏式. While 起伏式 is further divided into [[頭高型]], [[中高型]] and [[尾高型]], there are no subcategories to 平板式. When contrasting with 頭高型, 中高型 or 尾高型, it is customary to use the word 平板型 to avoid the discrepancy of comparing [[型]] with [[式]].
