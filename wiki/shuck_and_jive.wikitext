'''Shuckin' and Jivin' ''', a term popularized amongst [[African Americans]] of North America primarily, loosely means "to sit
around in a group, outdoing each other with lies and
exaggerations."

Its origin is unknown, however it most likely originated during
the US [[Slavery]] period, when African Americans were forced to
perform menial labor. To entertain themselves, they were probably
taken to playing games similar to [[playing the dozens]] or
telling tall tales while performing work, such as [[shucking corn]]. See also [[Jive]].

Nowadays Shuckin' and Jivin' can also refer to a group of
[[busybodies]] or other foolish people. For example, "Those guys
are always down by the store, shuckin' and jivin' about the new
family's business."
