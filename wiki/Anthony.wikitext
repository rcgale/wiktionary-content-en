===Etymology===
Possibly "priceless" (Greek) or "flower" from Greek anthos but most likely of unknown Etruscan origin. From a Roman family name.

Latin: 
L. [[Antonius]], name of a Roman gens (with excrescent -h- probably suggested by many Gk. loan words beginning anth-, e.g. άνθος "flower", άνθρωπος "man").
Roman clan name of uncertain etymology; popular definitions include highly praiseworthy, priceless, flourishing, prince, flower.

From the Roman family name Antonius, which is of unknown Etruscan origin. It is sometimes claimed to mean "flower" from Greek anthos. Famous bearers include Marcus Antonius, the Roman General, the 3rd-century Saint Anthony the Abbot, a hermit from Egypt who founded monasticism, and the 13th-century Saint Anthony of Padua, the patron saint of Portugal.
