The highest of male singers' ranges; above that of a countertenor. Typically ranging from A below middle C to high G, this voice type is very rare, apparent only in men who use a strengthened and trained falsetto to attain such vocal flexibility. Typically, such range diminishes as puberty progresses, resulting in a vibrant countertenor voice. Also may refer to a boy before puberty whose voice has not yet developed and therefore possesses very high pitch.
