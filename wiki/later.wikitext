===Adverb===
'''later'''

#The [[comparative]] of the adverb ''[[late]]''; more late.
#:''You came in late yesterday and today you came in even later.''
#Afterward in time (used with ''than'' when comparing with another time).
#:''My roommate arrived first.  I arrived later.''<!-- (but we could both have been on time)-->
#:''I arrived later than my roommate.''<!-- (ditto) -->
#At some unspecified time in the future.
#:''I wanted to do it know, but I'll have to do it later.''

<!--Isn't this explained by the definitions above?
====Usage note====
''Later'' is not quite the same as ''more late'' (which is rare in any case).  In ''I arrived late.'' I didn't arrive until after someone expected me to.  In ''I arrived later.'' there need not be any such expectation.  This just means I arrived after some given time or event.
