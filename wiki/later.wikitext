==English==

===Adverb===
# Afterward in time.  Often used with ''than''.
#: ''My roommate arrived first.  I arrived later.'' (but we could both have been on time)
#: ''I arrived later than my roommate.'' (ditto)
# At some unspecified time in the future.
#: ''I wanted to do it know, but I'll have to do it later.''

====Usage note====
''Later'' is not quite the same as ''more late'' (which is rare in any case).  In ''I arrived late.'' I didn't arrive until after someone expected me to.  In ''I arrived later.'' there need not be any such expectation.  This just means I arrived after some given time or event.

===Interjection===
# (''slang'') See you later; goodbye
#: ''Later, dude.''
