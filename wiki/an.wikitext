'''an'''

# Used when the noun may refer to one of several possibilities; ''an egg'' could be any of several, while ''the egg'' refers to a specific egg.
# In each; to or for each
#: ''I was only going twenty miles an hour''
#: ''The consultant was paid $1000 a day.''

====Etymology====
Shortened form of [[an]] [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[&#257;n]] (one). See [[One]]
<!-- Second sense may have this etymology (?):
Derived from the preposition meaning "on"
-->


====Usage Note====

The alternate form [[a]] is used before consonants.  This rule refers to pronunciation, not spelling, so

* ''a dog''
* ''an egg''
* ''an hour'' (''h'' is not pronounced)
* ''a hog'' (''h'' is pronounced)
* ''a yak'' (''y'' counts as a consonant)
* ''a user'' (''u'' is pronounced as ''yu'')
* ''an umbrella''
* ''a woman'' (''w'' counts as a consonant)
* ''a one'' (pronouced the same as "won")
* ''an onion''

There is one occasional exception.  The form ''an'' is sometimes used before ''h'' even when the ''h'' is pronounced.  The usual example is ''an historic occasion.''  Though current in some dialects that pronounce the ''h'', this is considered by many to be affected or pedantic.

'''an'''

#Name of the first [[letter]] of the [[Georgian]] alpahabet.
