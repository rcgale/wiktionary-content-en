#:'''Quotations'''
#:*'''1786''': The [[Chanfron]], [[Chamfrein]], or [[Shaffron]] took it's [[denomination]] from that part of the horse's head it covered, and was a kind of [[mask]] of [[iron]], [[copper]], or [[brass]], and sometimes of [[jacked]] [[leather]], enclosing the face and ears, some of these [[chanfron]]s seem to have been [[contrived]] as to [[hinder]] a horse from [[see]]ing right before him, perhaps to prevent his being [[intimidate]]d by any object against which he might be [[direct]]ed, so as to cause him to [[start]] [[aside]], or lessen the [[celerity]] of his [[charge]]. &mdash; Francis Grose, ''A Treatise on Ancient Armour and Weapons'', page 29.
