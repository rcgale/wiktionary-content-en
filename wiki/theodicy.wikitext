Theodicy (Noun)


'''Definition:''' 

Examples or arguments used to vindicate God in view of the existence of evil.  


'''Background:''' 

Arguments have been made to deny the existence of God (Judeo-Christian God) due to the problem of evil.  Evil are things such as suffering from terminal illness, death of young children, and natural disasters, etc.  If God is all good, then why does God allow so much suffering in the world?  

Free will defense is one most used in theodicy to say that God is not the problem.  Manâ€™s free will and his choices are the causes of all his sufferings.
