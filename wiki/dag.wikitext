'''Dag''' can mean several things:

# In mathematics, '''Dag''' or '''DAG''' is an abbreviation for a [[directed acyclic graph]].
# In [[Norse mythology]], '''Dag''' is an ancestor of [[Ottar]].
# An Australian term, meaning many things.  According to the Macquarie dictionary, '''dag''' originally referred to "the wool on a sheep's rear quarters, often dirty with mud and excreta".  Sheep poop in other words.  "Rattle your '''dags'''" has been used to urge kids to hurry up.  Eventually '''dag''' came to describe a person.  The qualities being evoked range from conservative, unsophisticated and slovenly, to eccentric, goofy, amusing and loveable.  To attempt the translation: '''dag''' might encompass the equivalent of anything from geek to slob to nut.  Calling someone a '''dag''' might call forth any combination of these qualities.  Along with the Australian proclivity to show affection via insult, this causes some difficulty in explaining the intended meaning to others (Americans).  Much is taken from the context and the tone of voice in which it is spoken.
