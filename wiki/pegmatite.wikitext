:peg' muh tite 

===Noun===
#A coarsely [[crystal]]line [[igneous]] or [[plutonic]] [[rock]] composed primarily of [[feldspar]] and [[quartz]], normally with [[muscovite]] and/or [[biotite]] [[mica]]. Often contains other [[mineral]]s, which may be of economic importance. Pegmatite is chemically identical to [[granite]], but has a much coarser crystal structure. Common colors are gray, white, and pink. Pegmatite is quarried for decorative stone and as a source of [[beryllium]], [[columbium]] and [[tantalum]] when these are present. [[Gemstone]]s of the quartz/silicate family may also be found in pegmatites.
