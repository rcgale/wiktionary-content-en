'''going to'''

#Going is the present participle of "to go" and "to," in this case, denotes an inifnitive.  "Going to" is technically a progressive participle, in which "going" serves as an auxillary verb, and is always preceded by the verb [[to be]] or a [[conjugation]] thereof.  It is, however, almost always used as form of the future tense: I am '''going to''' do do, I [[will]] do, I [[shall]] do); or as the past progressive(imperfect) to indicate definite non-completion: "I was '''going to''' do" as as opposed to "I was doing."
