===Suffix===
'''-est'''

#Used to form the [[superlative]] of those [[adjective]]s and [[adverb]]s whose etymology is from Germanic and not from Latin, in which case ''most'' must be used.
#:''longest'', ''biggest'', ''fastest''
#Used to form the [[archaic]] [[second-person]] [[singular]] [[present tense]] of verbs.
#:''goest'', ''makest''

====Usage notes====
#Final ''y'' becomes ''i'' when this suffix is added ('''easy''', '''easiest''').
#This suffix may be used to form the superlative of:
#:*adjectives and adverbs that have one syllable('''hot''', '''hottest'''; '''fast''', '''fastest''');
#:*some, but not all, adjectives that have two syllables ('''funny''', '''funniest''').
#Most longer adjectives, and adjectives that are participles, form the superlative using '''most''' ('''enormous''', '''most enormous'''; '''burnt''', '''most burnt'''; '''freezing''', '''most freezing''').
#If in doubt, use '''most''' instead ('''thirsty''' may become '''thirstiest''' but '''most thirsty''' would also be acceptable).
