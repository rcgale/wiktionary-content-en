'''Free On Board''' is a commercial term which specifies the location where the ownership of goods is transferred from seller to buyer. It originates from shipping by boat and meant that the seller had fulfilled all obligations to deliver once the goods were on board the vessel. In modern sales contracts, e.g., "F.O.B. Warehouse" or "F.O.B. Destination", it specifies when each party owns title and assumes the risks and costs of transport.
