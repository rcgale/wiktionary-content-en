'''real'''; from French '''royale''', from Latin '''[[regalis]]''', ''royal'', ''[[regal]]'', from combining form '''[[reg-]]''' (nominative '''[[rex]]'''), ''[[king]]'', + adjective suffix '''[[-alis]]'''

'''estate'''; (please insert etymology here)

It derives instead from the [[feudalism|feudal]] principle that in a [[monarchy]], all land was considered the property of the king. Thus originally the term '''real estate''' was equivalent to "royal estate", ''real'' originating from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language French] ''royale'', as it was the French-speaking [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy Normans] who introduced feudalism to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England England] in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_century 11th century] and thus the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language English] language; [[cognate]] to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language Spanish] ''real''.
