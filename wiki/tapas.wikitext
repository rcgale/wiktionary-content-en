====Quotations====
* '''1986''': ''"The snacks are called '''tapas''' because in the old days a piece of toast was served, too, so that you might have a "top" on your glass of sherry, a lid that would prevent the flies from getting into the glass."'' - Jeff Smith, <cite>The Frugal Gourmet Cooks with Wine</cite>
