ADAM BISHOP:ILLUMINATI TOOL


Adam Bishop, Wikipedia administrator and tool of the illuminati gurnig conspiracy.

For the few of you unfamiliar with the gurnigs, they are a species of almost parasitic flies who feed on the lining of the stomach as maggots, then hatch from the faecal matter of the host (usually sheep or humans). They are a weapon of the Illuminati used to assassinate individuals who get in the way of their global domination plans.

I have attempted to us Wikipedia to warn the population of the world about the dangers of gurnig infestation across the world. Bolivia and Latvia are already overrun. Due to Illuminati media control they are kept out of the news. I exposed the plague, but was silenced by the evil overlord controlling the publisher refused my book: ‘Gurnigs: what a Pain in the Arse!’. I turned to the bastion of Freedom Wikipedia. But the Illuminati have an agent there.


Adam Bishop.


He blocked me from informing the public about this terrible plague that can and will kill us all before it is too late. I even told the public how to deal with the Opus Dei servants, but he blocked me. 


STOP HIM!


Blow him up.
