'''Regulome''' refers to the whole set of regulation components in a cell, tissue, organ, organisms, and species. They are usually used in the context of signal transduction. Regulation materials of cells vary much. Even water can be an important regulome entity. 

Regulome is to completely map the regulation circuits of biological cells. It collects various heterogeneous biological entities that are critical in forming regulation pathways. Biochemistry used to take the role of understanding regulations. However, regulome is at genome-scale with computational tools and rules.
The final aim of regulome is to construct an in silico regulation simulation package.
