In [[kinship and descent]], an '''apical ancestor''' is a common ancestor from whom a [[lineage]] or [[clan]] may trace its descent.  The word ''apical'' is used because this ancestor is at the [[apex]] of the [[genealogy]].  In the case of clans, this may be an assumed or fictional ancestor chosen for unification purposes.  If the apical ancestor of a clan is nonhuman, it is a [[totem]].
