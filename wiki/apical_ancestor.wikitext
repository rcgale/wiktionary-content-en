In [[anthropology]], an '''apical ancestor''' is a common ancestor from whom a [[lineage]] or [[clan]] may trace its descent.  The word ''apical'' is used because this ancestor is at the apex of the genealogy.  In the case of clans, this may be an assumed or fictional ancestor chosen for unification purposes.  If the apical ancestor of a clan is nonhuman, it is a [[totem]].
