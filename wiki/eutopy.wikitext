also '''eutopie'''

Literally "good place" as a practical aim. Compare with [[Utopia]], literally "no place" -  an unattainable ideal. First used by Sir Thomas More in his book "Utopia":

"Wherfore not Utopie, but rather rightely my name is Eutopie, a place of felicitie."

Purdy has suggested the anglicisation of the spelling as eutopy with the emphasis on the first syllable, also eutopic, eutopism, eutopology.
