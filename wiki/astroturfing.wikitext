/az troh turf eng/

==Verb==

#To create a sythetic [[grass roots]] movement through use of [[shill]]s, volunteers who generate a fictional public concern, or professional organizations intended to create an impression that there is serious public interest in a particular topic, when either in reality there is no interest, or public interest is generally opposite to that being presented.
