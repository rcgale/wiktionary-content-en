In American slang, a '''patsy''' is a person taken advantage of, especially one considered relatively na&iuml;ve.  The term is widely regarded as an ethnic slur, in light of the likely theory that it arose in the mid-[[18th century|18<sup>th</sup> century]] when East Coast urban centers in the U.S. included a notable abundance of recent migrants from rural Ireland, among whom nickname Patsy (for Patrick, after the [[Saint Patrick|patron saint of Ireland]]) was relatively common.

Two main contexts of the general term, at least in fiction, are:
* [[confidence game]]s, where the patsy in question is the "mark" intended to be deceived and thereby deprived of something of value, and
* [[frame-up]]s by a perpetrator of a crime, who manipulates evidence to incriminate and thus [[scapegoat]] the patsy, who may be either an innocent party, or a confederate whom the framer regards as expendable. The description as patsies may apply over a wide range of circumstances, from the betrayal being an inherant part of the planned crime concealed from the patsy, to its being a spur-of-the-moment response to an unanticipated problem.
