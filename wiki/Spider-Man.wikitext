The Spiderman is yet another "sex move" derived from the Houdini and is also performed during doggy-style sex. The male, upon approaching orgasim, pulls out, fakes his orgasim, and spits on his partner's back. This is to fool the female that he has just ejaculated on the small of her back. Having been fooled by the fake orgasim, the man's partner often looks back with loving affection. At this point (having not achieved orgasim), the male quickly quickly pleasures himself and ejaculates in the palm of his hand. He then throws the ejaculate into his partners face yelling "THWIP!"  Thwip is the onomatopea used in the popular Spiderman comics to represent the sound Spiderman's webslingers make.
