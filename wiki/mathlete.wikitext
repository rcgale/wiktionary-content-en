A mathlete is a [[portmanteu]] of the words [[math]] and [[athlete]].  

The word is usually used to refer to someone very dedicated to the math team of a [[primary school]] or [[secondary school]].  More specifically, a mathlete is to the math team as an [[athlete]] is to a sports team.  This word is especially [[ironic]] because [[stereotypically]], those who do well in math team tend to be [[diametrically opposite]] to real athletes.  

The best mathletes in the [[United States]] place highly on the [[AIME]], [[USAMO]], and [[ARML]].  Those who excel at the [[ATPAC]], [[ASMA]], and [[NAT]] are, fortunately or unfortunately, not real mathletes.  Those in other countries should also do well on national olympiads (feeders to the [[IMO]]) to qualify.  Note that mathlete is an [[American]] term.

The term is usually used in a joking manner, or at least with a humorous tone.  If someone uses the word seriously, that person may be deemed insane by the [[Rashin Test]], devised based on the behavior of [[Abraham Rashin]].
