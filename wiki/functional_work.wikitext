A '''functional work''' is a [[work]] that can be considered to be of practical use, such as [[software]], [[encyclopedia]]s, [[dictionary|dictionaries]] and [[textbook]]s.

People, such as [[Richard Stallman]], use the term to distinguish functional work from texts written with a certain ''[[point of view]]'' and from artistic works. This in order to avoid the general term ''[[content]]''.
