A '''Mexican breakfast''' is an [[United States|American]] idiom for a breakfast consisting of "a cigarette and a glass of water," supposedly because that is all [[Mexico|Mexicans]] can afford.  The phrase, generally used in obviously [[derogatory]] metaphors and similies, is part of a theme in US slang where the adjective "Mexican" implies something substandard or pointless.
