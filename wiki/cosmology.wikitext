'''Verb'''

Cosmology is the study of the universe at both its large and small scales.  Cosmology is a theorectical endeavor that seeks to answer questions about the evolution and fate of the universe.  Usually, as a science, cosmology is considered to be a branch of astronomy.  However, a matter of opinion would say that astronomy is a branch of cosmology, since astronomy is the study of the objects ''within'' the universe, while cosmology studies the universe in totality (including the dimension of time).  As with all things theorectical, cosmology has its philosophical elements that also attract spirituality; thereby making it an accepted metaphysical practice.
