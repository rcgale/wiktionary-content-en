An Irish insult for a Protestant. Usually used in [[Northern Ireland]] to describe an [[Ulster Protestant]] with [[loyalist]] sympathies, by [[Irish Catholics]] who tend to be [[Irish nationalist]]. the term is considered very offensive, and in many cases is said in response to the many Protestant insults coined for Irish Catholics; ex. [[taig]], [[mick]], [[fenian]], [[white nigger]], and [[paddy]].

The term is also used by [[Roman Catholic]] fans of the [[Glasgow]] [[football]] team, [[Celtic FC]]; to insult [[Protestant]] fans of their rivals, the [[Rangers FC]]. 

It is sometimes used by non-Irish Catholics in the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Scotland]], in particuliar), [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] in areas where Protestant-Catholic antagonism runs high.
