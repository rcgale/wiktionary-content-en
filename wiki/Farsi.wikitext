==Etymology==
Directly from the local term for the province of Persis ("[[Fars]]") in southern Iran, adopted by Persians to refer to their language after Islamic invasions in the 7th century.

===Proper noun===
'''Farsi''' is an Arabicized form of Persian, which refers to the modern language of Persians and more generally its dialects. It is the official language of [[Iran]], spoken by the majority of the country. A dialect, [[Dari]], is spoken by a plurality of the people of Afghanistan (50%) and has official status there. Other dialects of it are spoken within other countries in the area, such as [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]]. Persian is called Tajiki-persian in [[Tajikistan]] and is the official language of that country. Persian is a member of the [[Indo-Iranian]] branch of the [[Indo-European]] family of languages.   
Using the word "''Farsi''" instead of Persian in an English text is seen by some as similar to using the words ''Nederlands'' and ''Suomi'' instead of Dutch and Finnish while writing in English.
