===Noun===
'''set phrase'''
#''(grammar)'': A common [[phrase]], that is not an [[idiom]], (as the sum of the [[word]]s mean what they say), is not a [[colloquialism]] (because the phrase is composed of real words), and usually is not a [[catch phrase]] (as the phrase has not yet been overused by media or fictional characters for advertising.)
