'''[[set]] [[phrase]]'''

#''(grammar)'': A common [[phrase]] that usually is not considered an [[idiom]], (as the sum of the [[word]]s mean what they say), nor a [[colloquialism]] (because the phrase is composed of real words), nor a [[catch phrase]] (as the phrase has not yet been overused by media or fictional characters for advertising.)
