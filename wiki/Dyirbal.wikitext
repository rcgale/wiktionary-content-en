'''Dyirbal'''

Language spoken in northeastern [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. Dyirbal is one of the [[Pama-Nyungan]] languages (a branch of the Australian language family).

Historically, there were six dialects of Dyirbal: Jirrbal (or Dyirbal), Giramay, Mamu, Ngadyan, Dyiru and Gulay (which, along with the separate Warrgamay language, make up the Dyirbalic subbranch). Today, the Dyirbalic languages and dialects are almost all extinct, and perhaps only five elderly speakers of Jirrbal, and one of Giramay, survive.

Dyirbal is [[agglutinative]] and suffixing. While its pronouns are of the [[nominative]]/[[accusative]] type, the nouns are [[absolutive]]/[[ergative]]...a so-called "[[split-ergative]]" system.

Because Dyirbal is a highly inflected language, word order is extremely free. There are four noun classes, three numbers (singular, dual, plural), and nine cases. Verbs have two conjugations and two tenses, and employ a host of exotic and unusual aspectual and derivational suffixes.
