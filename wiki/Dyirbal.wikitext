'''[[w:Dyirbal_language|Dyirbal]]'''

Language spoken in northeastern [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. [[w:Dyirbal_language|Dyirbal]] is one of the [[Pama-Nyungan]] languages (a branch of the Australian language family).

Historically, there were six dialects of Dyirbal: Jirrbal (or Dyirbal), Giramay, Mamu, Ngadyan, Dyiru and Gulay (which, along with the separate Warrgamay language, make up the Dyirbalic subbranch). Today, the Dyirbalic languages and dialects are almost all extinct, and perhaps only five elderly speakers of Jirrbal, and one of Giramay, survive.
