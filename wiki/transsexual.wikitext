===Usage Note===
The nominative use of ''transsexual'' is sometimes regarded by transsexual people as inappropriate, as this may detract from the primacy of their gender identity.   Example: ''"I am a transsexual woman."''  Likewise, ''transman'' and ''transwoman'' primarily refer to any transgender persons; transsexual persons may or may not identify as transgender or adopt such terms.  Slang usage such as ''transie'', ''tranny'', and ''shemale'' may also refer to either transgender or transsexual persons, but are nearly universally considered pejorative.
