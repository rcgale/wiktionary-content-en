==== Usage warning ====
Some people consider the jargonistic transitive form of this word to be improper, on the grounds that it is untraditional, and that if a transitive verb is to be constructed from ''migrate'' it should still be the subject that is doing the migrating.  Alternatives include ''move'', ''herd'', ''transfer'', or ''relocate''.  This objection is not widespread however, and ''migrate'' is the only term generally used to mean specifically the movement of computer code from one computer to another.  Usually both computers are [[server|servers]] of some sort.
