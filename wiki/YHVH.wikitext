== [[proper noun]] ==
#known as the "[[tetragrammaton]]", the four Hebrew letters יהוה 
which are transliterated into the Latin alphabet as YHVH (or IHVH, JHVH, or YHWH). These are usually combined with vowels in English to arrive at the spelling "[[Jehovah]]" but some Bible scholars agree that a perhaps closer pronunciation to the original Hebrew word would be something like "[[Yahweh]]".
