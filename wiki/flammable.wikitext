===Etymology===
''flammable'' is a word coined out of safety concerns.  Originally [[inflammable]] was used to label trucks and containers holding flammable liquids such as [[gasoline]].  However, this produced dangerous confusion, as some interpreted the initial ''in'' to mean "not".  So the word ''flammable'' was "[[back-formation|back-form]]ed" for labeling such objects.
