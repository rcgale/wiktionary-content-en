A slide projector with two parallel lenses. One projected image could be faded to the other by simultaneously opening one lens cover while opening the other. Stereo vision is not actually simulated. Commonly used by travelling lecturers, c. 1900. The name "steropticon" is often mistakenly applied to "stereoscopes," which do provide stereoscopic views.
