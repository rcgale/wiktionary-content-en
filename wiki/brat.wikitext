===Noun===
'''brat''' (plural: [[brats]])

The term '''''brat''''' is usually used to describe a [[selfish]], [[spoil]]ed or [[unruly]] [[child]] who thinks of nothing but him or herself.  Usually mentally pictured as a child throwing a [[temper tantrum]] for not getting his or her way.

While it is generally used as a term for children, a [[teenager]] or [[adult]] can still be considered to be a brat if they display the same selfish tendencies.
