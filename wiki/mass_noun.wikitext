'''[[mass]] [[noun]]''' (''plural'': mass nouns)

#A [[noun]] describing something that cannot be counted, usually with no plural form and used without the indefinite article.  Examples: [[information]], [[money]], [[soap]].  In contrast, [[dollar]] and [[euro]] are examples of [[count noun]]s.  Some nouns, such as [[wine]], can be either mass nouns or count nouns: as a mass noun, ''wine'' refers to wine in general; as a count noun (with plural ''wines'') ''wine'' refers to a variety of wine.
