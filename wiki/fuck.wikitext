===Etymology===
First use in print is 16th century, but the word is probably much older.  Compare with Swedish ''[[focka]]'' and Dutch ''[[fokken]]'' (to breed). The Indo-European origins are largely hypothetical, and are based on a common root meaning "to strike."  This has led to the Latin ''[[pugnus]]'' fist, and several other derivations in a wide range of Indo-European and Mediterranean languages.

The popular etymology whereby "fuck" is an acronym meaning "For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge" has no basis in fact.

There are many words used euphemistically for fuck such as the f-word, four letter word, [[naff]].
