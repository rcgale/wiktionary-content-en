===Etymology===
First use in print is 15th century, in code and in pseudo-Latin (''gxddbov'', for ''fuccant'').  Compare with Swedish ''[[focka]]'' and Dutch ''[[fokken]]'' (to breed). The Indo-European origins are largely hypothetical, and are based on a common root meaning "to strike."  This has led to the Latin ''[[pugnus]]'' fist, and several other derivations in a wide range of Indo-European and Mediterranean languages.

====Popular Belief====
Popular belief holds a number of origins for the word "fuck", mainly relating to acronyms for the word, some examples include:
* For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge
* Fornication Under Consent of the King
These beliefs have no basis in fact.

There are many words used euphemistically for fuck such as the f-word, four letter word, [[naff]].
