Without equal; matchless; without equivocation or ambiguity, meaning a singularly clear, unmistakable, unquestionable thing or action. The word is typically used in English as an adjective describing a great achievement, masterpiece or undeniable success, though it may also fittingly describe a thing that is clear, focused and unambiguous. Unequivocal is not a noun.

Examples:
* "I wanted to do something in my life that was [[unequivocal]]."
* "Her prom dress was unequivocally exotic."
* At the time of its construction, the scope and size of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]'s construction was unequivocal.


== Etymology ==

c.1380, from old French ''equivocation'', from late Latin ''æquivocationem'' (nom. ''æquivocatio''), from ''æquivocus'' "an audibly identical sound," from Latin ''æquus'' meaning "equal" + vocare "to call". The suffix "un" simply means the opposite of. Thus, unequivocal evolved literally as something which is ''said'' or ''spoken'' to be without equal.
