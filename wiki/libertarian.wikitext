==English==
===Etymology===
From French ''[[libertaire]]'' ("[[anarchist]]"), formed from ''[[liberté]]'' ("freedom", from Latin ''libertas'') and the suffix ''-aire'' (from Latin ''-arius'').

N.B. The French term was coined when anarchist publications were banned by law in France.  The anarchists invented the synonym ''libertaire'' in order to skirt the ban.
