A '''ramrod''' is a device used with early [[firearm]]s to push the [[projectile]] up against the [[propellant]] (mainly [[gunpowder]]).

The term is also used to describe a person who takes responsibility for accomplishing or running things (e.g. "I'm Olivares.  I'm ramrod around here." - ''Sho-sa'' Esau Olivares, Robert N. Charette's ''Heir to the Dragon''), or for the act of accomplishing or running things (e.g. "I'm the one that ramrodded that new bill through [[Congress]]").
