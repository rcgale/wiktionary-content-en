A '''woven''' is a cloth formed by [[weaving]].

It only stretches in the [[bias#textiles|bias]] directions (between the [[warp]] and [[weft]] directions.

Woven cloth usually [[frays]] at the edges, unless measures are taken to counter this, such as the use of [[pinking shears]] or [[hemming]].

Most cloth in use is woven.
