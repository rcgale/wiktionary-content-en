A '''woven''' is a [[cloth]] formed by [[weaving]].  It only stretches in the [[bias#textiles|bias]] directions (between the [[warp]] and [[weft]] directions), unless the threads are elastic.  Woven cloth usually [[fray|frays]] at the edges, unless measures are taken to counter this, such as the use of [[pinking shears]] or [[hemming]].
Most cloth in use is woven.
