==== Usage note ====
According to traditional usage, ''eponym'' refers to the original name upon which a word is based, but not to the word based on that name (except with proper nouns and medical terms, where the person's name is usually capitalized).  There is a similar distinction with ''[[archetype]]'', and like ''archetype'' it is common to see the term inverted and used to refer to the derived form rather than just the source.
