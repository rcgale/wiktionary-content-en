Any extremely pleasurable feeling one experiences after seeing, or hearing, something particularly cool, esp. within the realm of genre or niche entertainment.

For example, ''"man, the trailer for '''Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith''' just gave me a '''geekasm'''!"''

Further usage: ==When they build a machine, if they do the calculations right, the machine works and you get this intense ... uhh ... just like a '''geekasm''', from knowing that what you created in your mind and on the computer is actually doing what you told it to do== - ''MIT professor Alex Slocum, Scientific American Frontiers, May 21st 2002''
