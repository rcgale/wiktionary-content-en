'''''Jesus freak''''' was originally a derogatory term applied to those involved in the [[Jesus Movement]] of the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]] who were often considered overzealous in their passion for [[Jesus]]. Perhaps its most well-known usage was in the lyrics of [[Elton John]]'s song "Tiny Dancer". 
The term has recently been used frequently by [[Howard Stern]] and [[Ted Turner]]. However, it is also occasionally used today by [[Christians]], especially Christian youth, as a positive term to let others know that they are not ashamed of their belief in Jesus.
