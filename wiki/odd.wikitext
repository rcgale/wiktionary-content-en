==Etymology==

Derived from Old Norse ''oddi'' (''third or additional number''), which comes from ''oddr'' (''point of a weapon'') via an intermediate meaning of "[[triangle]]". The original meaning is adjective 4 (left over).

Further back, ''oddr'' derives from Germanic *[[uzdaz]] (''pointing upward'') and Indogermanic *[[uzdho]].
