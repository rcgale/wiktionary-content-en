Standing up for your rights and not being taken advantage of is one definition of being assertive.

It also means communicating what you really want in a clear fashion, respecting your own rights and feelings and the rights and feelings of others.

Assertion is an honest and appropriate expression of one's feelings, opinions, and needs.
