Large warship displacing tens of thousands of tons, heavily armoured and armed with big guns. Battleships are now obsolescent, replaced by smaller vessels with guided missiles. 

Term derived from [[ship of the line of battle]], which gave rise to [[battleship]] and the obsolete expression [[ship of the line]]
