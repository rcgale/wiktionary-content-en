===Etymology===
This word has its origins in the Latin ''artificium'' or skill, from ''artifex'', from ''ars'' skill and ''-fex'' (''facere'', to make) , and comes via old French. So, arguably, it could be expanded to encompass items that come about due to a deliberate process not due to humans, viz robots built by robots.

===Adjective===
'''artificial'''

# Man-made; of artifice. ("The flowers were artificial, and he thought them rather tacky.") 
# False, misleading ("...her manner was somewhat artificial."
