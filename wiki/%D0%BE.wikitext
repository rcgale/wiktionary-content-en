==Cyrillic alphabet==
===Letter===
'''О''', '''о''' (''italics: '''О''', '''о''''')

#The sixteenth letter of the Russian [[Cyrillic]] alphabet. It is preceded by [[Н]] and followed by [[П]].

Its Russian name is '''о''' (ō) and in stressed syllables it has the sound of the long '''o''' in '''''o'''rphan''. In unstressed positions, it is pronounced as a [[schwa]], like the '''o''' in ''m'''o'''ther''. (Unstressed Russian '''о''' is pronounced the same as unstressed Russian '''а'''.)
