Naff means crap, not very good, or it can be used euphemastically for [[fuck]] in the phrase [[naff]] off. It is derived from the [[polaris]] word ''naph'', and no doubt was popularised and hence changed its spelling due to be used on the BBC radio programme <i>Round the Horne</i> by Julian and Sandy in the 1960s.
