====Usage notes====
Even in mathematical contexts, ''square root'' generally means ''positive square root.''  If there is a chance of ambiguity, prefer constructions like ''a square root'' or ''a complex square root'' to indicate the strict definition, or ''the positive square root'' or similar to indicate the looser sense.
