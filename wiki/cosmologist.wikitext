A cosmologist is a person who studies the large-scale and small-scale structures of the universe.  It is important to note that cosmology may also have metaphysical interpretations, and that those who study cosmology do not have to be scientists.  However, metaphysics and philosophy aside, cosmologists tend to be the most technical of astronomers since their work is entirely theorectical.
