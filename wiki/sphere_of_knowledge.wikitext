A '''sphere of knowledge''' is a unified body or collection of knowledge regarding a specific subject, interest or otherwise area of expertise possessed by an individual.

For example, [[philately]], [[geology]] and [[zoology]] are all spheres of knowledge; so too are specific sub-divisions within these collections of knowledge.
Thus, [[petrology]], [[palaeontology]], [[mineralogy]], [[stratigraphy]], [[tectonics]], [[geophysics]] and [[geochemistry]] are all spheres of knowledge within geology, for example.
