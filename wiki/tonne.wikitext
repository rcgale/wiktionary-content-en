*A tonne (about 2204.6 [[pound]]s) is approximately equal to a [[ton]] (2240 pounds) and the difference is often not important.  However, because "tonne" is pronounced identically to "ton", there may be confusion about which unit is meant when the word is spoken.  This may be avoided by using "metric ton" where "tonne" is intended.  <!--what happens when "ton" is meant?-->
