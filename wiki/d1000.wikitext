A [[d1000]] is a roll used occasionally in some [[Role-playing game|RPG]]s and [[wargaming|wargames]]. It is almost always generated by rolling 3 differently [[colour]]ed [[Ten-sided die|d10]], having stated each colour is either the hundreds, tens, or units digit. Alternatively, roll a [[Percentile die|d100]] for tens and units, and a d10 as the hundreds digit. The d1000 is usually only used for very large randomization tables, or for large tables where having significantly different ranges for different results is considered to be important.
