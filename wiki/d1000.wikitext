A [[d1000]] is a roll used ocasionaly in some [[RPG]]s and [[wargames]]. It is almost always generated by rolling 3 differntly [[coloured]] [[d10]], having stated each colour is either the hundreds, tens, or units digit. Alternatively, roll a [[d100]] for tens and units, and a d10 as the hundreds digit. The d1000 is usualy only used for very large randomization tables, or for large tables where having significantly different ranges for different results is considered to be important. <br><br>
