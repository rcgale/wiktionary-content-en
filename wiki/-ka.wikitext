===Note===
:There are other suffixes that serve the same purpose in Slovak. So, you cannot just take any masculine Slovak word and add '''-ka''' to produce the feminine version. However, it is useful in determining the meaning of an unknown feminine Slovak word if you have its original masculine word. And it gives you a good idea of its declension.
