==== Usage note ====
Traditionally ''archetype'' refers to the model upon which something is based, but it has also come to mean anything, particular a character in a story, that is based on a well-established model.  In this fashion, a character based on the Jesus archetype might be referred to as a "Jesus archetype", or even just an "archetype" if the emphasis is on the character being derivative or a cliche.
