I was looking up vitamins and minerals online and found the word "reprecipitation" listed on this page:

Here is the text from the page:

Magnesium Salts

The in vitro solubility and in vivo GI absorbability of magnesium oxide and magnesium citrate were compared (Lindberg et al., 1990). The simulated gastric fluids represented five different concentrations of hydrochloric acid. Magnesium citrate was significantly more soluble than magnesium oxide in all levels of acid secretion, but reprecipitation from magnesium oxide and magnesium citrate did not occur when the hydrochloric acid was titrated to a pH between 6 and 7, which is the pH of the distal small intestine where magnesium anions are absorbed. Absorption of the two magnesium formulations was also compared in vivo by measuring the rise in urinary magnesium levels, and the citrate form was absorbed to a much greater extent than the oxide.

Could someone help with the definition?

Thanks!
