'''[[boiling]] [[point]]'''
#{{physics}} The [[temperature]] at which the [[liquid]] and [[gas]] [[phase]]s of a [[substance]] are in [[equilibrium]]; it is [[relatively]] [[insensitive]] to [[pressure]]. At the boiling point, the vapour pressure equals the atmospheric pressure. Hence, a higher atmospheric pressure causes the [[liquid]] to boil at a higher temperature, and vice versa. This is a problem for mountaineers who want to boil food like potatoes. Water boils at a lower temperature at elevated altitudes where the atmospheric pressure is lower. However, to cook the potatoes properly, a sufficient temperature must be reached (which can be overcome only in part by increasing the duration of cooking).
