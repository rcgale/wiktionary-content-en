To '''thrash''' is to move about violently.

*In [[computer architecture]], the term refers to poor performance of a [[virtual memory]] (or [[paging]]) system, when the same pages are being loaded repeatedly due to a lack of [[primary storage|main memory]] to keep them in memory. Depending on the configuration and algorithm, the real throughput of a system can degrade by one or two [[orders of magnitude]].
*In [[software testing]], '''thrashing''' means to extensively test a software system, giving a program various inputs and observing the behavior and outputs that result.
