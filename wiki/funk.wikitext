Decades ago, in common parlance, the smell of sex was referred to as "'''funk'''."  At least one popular dictionary as late as the 1970s defined it as the smell of sexual intercourse.  Used more broadly, the term refers to any foul or unpleasant smell, esp. body odor.

The word "funk" was commonly regarded as coarse or indecent.  As late as the 1950s and early 1960s, when "funk" and "funky" were used increasingly in the context of soul music, the terms still were considered indelicate,  inappropriate for use in polite company.
