=== Etymology ===
In the modern sense, from J.K. Rowling's [[Harry Potter]] novels

=== Noun ===
'''muggle''' ([[muggles]])

# ('''Muggle''') Someone &ldquo;without a drop of magical blood in them&rdquo;, a non-magical human being (see usage note 1).
# By extension, a specialised term used by members of a group to refer to someone outside that group (see usage note 2).
# [[Marijuana]] (see usage note 3).

====Usage notes====
#'''Muggle''' is capitalised in the Harry Potter books but spelled with a lower-case initial in the other senses.
#In the sense of someone not belonging to a group, the term is used by groups such as [[pagan]]s to refer to non-pagans and IT support professionals to refer to the [[computer-illiterate]].  Compare [[mundane]], previously used by some of the same groups for the same purpose.
#Some sources say that '''muggle''' in the sense of marijuana is obsolete, but see [http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/streetterms/ByAlpha.asp?strTerm=M], which considers it still to be a &ldquo;street term&rdquo;.
