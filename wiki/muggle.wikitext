In the modern sense, from J.K. Rowling's [[Harry Potter]] novels

=== Noun ===
'''muggle''' ([[muggles]])

# someone &ldquo;without a drop of magical blood in them&rdquo;, a non-magical human being.
# used by people within a group to refer to outsiders, such as IT support professionals to refer to the computer-illiterate.  Compare with [[mundane]], previously used by some of the same groups for the same purpose.
# Marijuana.  (Note: some sources say obsolete, but see [http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/streetterms/ByAlpha.asp?strTerm=M], so still considered a &ldquo;street term&rdquo;.)
