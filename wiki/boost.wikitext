'''Boost''' in [[automotive engineering]] is a positive [[manifold (automotive engineering)|manifold]] [[pressure]] in cars with [[turbocharger]]s or [[supercharger]]s. 

Boost is quantifiable as the pressure above [[atmospheric pressure]] that the turbocharger or supercharger is creating in the engine's inlet manifold, and is usually measured in [[bar (unit)|bar]] or [[inch]]es of [[mercury (element)|mercury]].
