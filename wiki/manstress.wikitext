manstress - Male equivalent of "mistress"; an object of one's affections who lies outside of one's primary relationship.

e.g., Tom and Nicole had been married for several years, but it was well known that she was keeping a manstress on the side.

The term itself was first coined by a Christopher Kader of Hamilton, New Zealand -- a noted linguist --  and since then has entered into widespread usage.
