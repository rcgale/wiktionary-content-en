'''Sprezzatura''' is the art of doing a difficult task so gracefully, that it looks effortless. ''Sprezzatura'' was first used in 1528 by [[Baldassare Castiglione]] in ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]''. The term began use in English in the mid-twentieth century, often to describe art. 

"...I have found quite a universal rule which in this matter seems to me valid above all others, and in all human affairs whether in word or deed: and that is to avoid affectation in every way possible as though it were some very rough and dangerous reef; and (to pronounce a new word perhaps) to practice in all things a certain ''Sprezzatura'' [nonchalance], so as to conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort and almost without any thought about it...."
