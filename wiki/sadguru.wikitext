The word '''sat''' means ''that which undergoes no change''. In modern Samskrta, '''sat''' means ''good'' and '''asat''' means ''bad'', but in Vaedika Samskrta, '''sat''' means ''that which undergoes no change''.
The entity by whose grace one comes into contact with '''sat''' (sat, the non-changeable entity, the non-changeable stance, the non-changeable nuclear entity around which so many electrons move) - that entity, or rather, that framework through which the Supreme counsciousness (Parama Purusa) is working is the Sadguru.
