# The eleventh day of September, 2001.

===Usage Note===

The particular form "9/11" derives from the American habit of writing month first, then day, contrary to most other nations.  Because of the particular significance of 11 September 2001, the notation "9/11" is generally understood to refer to that date.  The usage has been seen even outside the US and in languages other than English.
