# The eleventh day of September, 2001.

===Usage Note===

The particular form "9/11" derives from the American habit of writing month first, then day, contrary to most other nations.  Because of the particular significance of 11 September 2001, the notation "9/11" is understood to refer to that date even outside the US.

The notation "9/11" may, of course, also refer to a fraction, or to the 11th of September of any other year inside the US, or to the 9th day of November outside the US.
