The colloquial term '''fashionista''' refers to a devoted [[consumer]] of [[haute couture]] or to a worker in the  high-fashion industry. Such workers may find employment in the designing or [[promotion| publicising]] of [[fashion]] items.

The word appeared as early as [[1993]].

It remains a mystery why ''fashionista'' employs an apparently [[Spanish language | Spanish]] [[suffix]]: ''[[-ista]]''. Compare neologisms such as [[barista]], [[Sandinista]], [[Peronism | Peronista]], [[The Guardian | Guardianista]].
