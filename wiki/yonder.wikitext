#An archaic form of [[that]] which refers to an object not near the speaker or the listener. It is still used in some older dialects of English, but its use is mostly being replaced by [[that]]. <i>(This definition is incorrect; when the meaning is solely [[that]], use the word [[yon]]. When refering to "that object over there", use "yonder" or "over yonder". See the definition below.)</i>

Used in dialects South of the Mason-Dixon line, meaning [[there]], as in: over [[there]]. <i>My house is over yonder.</i>
