{{-usage-}}
The first two meanings above are similar in wording, but substantially different in meaning.  The first definition was the former meaning, expanded in the mid-20th century.  However, a politician using the word '''household''' today almost always intends the first meaning.  Ample context should be provided to distinguish which meaning is intended, or your readers will assume their own prefered meaning.

===Adjective===
