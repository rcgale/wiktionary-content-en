==[[noun]]==
#a male of a royal family who is the supreme ruler of his nation.
#a playing piece in [[chess]] which can only move one square in any direction except when "rooking" in which it may move more as it exchanges directions with the "rook" or "castle" piece. When the king piece is threatened beyond movement of escape it is called "[[checkmate]]", i.e. "the king is dead" and the game is over.
#a playing card with the image of a king on it.
