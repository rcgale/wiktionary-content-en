===Noun===

A [[planetary body]] consisting of a piece of primarily rocky or metallic material found in [[space]].  They are believed to be the [[remnants]] of early [[planetesimal]]s which were destroyed by [[gravitational]] stresses or collisions with other planetesimals.  While they could be thought of as pieces of rock, their formation and composition are quite different from rocks found on [[Earth]].  As such, they hold many clues to the conditions and processes found in the early stages of [[solar system formation]].
