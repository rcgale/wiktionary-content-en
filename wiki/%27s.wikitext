===Usage Note===
Usage of the possessive marker with words ending in ''s'' varies.  The final ''s'' tends to be dropped after regular plurals.
* ''the dog's tail'' but ''the dogs' tails.''
and may or may not be dropped after words ending in ''s'' for other reasons
* ''St. James's'' or ''St. James'''

Irregular plurals with endings other than ''s'' always take '''s''.
* ''the children's voices''

Posessives can generally be recast using ''of the'', and this may be advisable if the contraction seems awkward.

* ''the tails of the dogs.''

Traditionally, the possessive of the biblical name Jesus is written without a final ''s''.

* ''Jesus' disciples''

This may or may not apply to the personal name Jesus in the Spanish pronucniation.

* ''This is Jesus Ramirez, and this is Jesus's wife.''
