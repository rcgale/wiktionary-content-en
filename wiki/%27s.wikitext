#Contraction of [[is]].

#Contraction of [[has]].
#:''The dog's been chasing the mail carrier again.''
#(''informal'') Contraction of [[does]].

====Usage notes====
*Usage of the possessive marker with words ending in ''s'' varies.  The final ''s'' is dropped after regular plurals.
**''the dog's tail'' but ''the dogs' tails.''
and may or may not be dropped after words ending in ''s'', depending on one's pronunciation (see the rule of thumb below)
**''St. James's'' or ''St. James'''

*Irregular plurals with endings other than ''s'' always take '''s''.
**''the children's voices''

*Possessives can generally be recast using ''of the'', and this may be advisable if the contraction seems awkward or ambiguous (which is often the case in speech).
**''the tails of the dogs.''

*Traditionally, the possessive of the biblical name Jesus is written without a final ''s''.
**''Jesus' disciples''

*This may or may not apply to the Spanish [[given name]] Jesus.
**''This is Jesus Ramirez, and this is Jesus's wife.''

*When referring to things possessed by two people, the strictly correct form is to form the possessive of both names, as in "Jack's and Jill's pails".  It is common to treat the pair of names as a noun phrase and to form its possessive instead, using only one '' 's'', as in "Jack and Jill's pails".

'''Rule of thumb'''
*An excellent rule of thumb for determining whether to add '' 's'' or an apostrophe alone is the following: '''If you add an ''s'' to the noun when pronouncing the possessive, add '' 's'' when writing the possessive; otherwise add only an apostrophe.'''  Examples:
**the possessive of ''dog'' is pronounced ''dogs'', so it is written as ''dog's'';
**the possessive of ''dogs'' is pronounced the same way, so it is written ''dogs' '';
**the possessive of ''James'' can be pronounced either ''Jameses'' or ''James'', so write ''James's'' or ''James' '' according to your pronunciation;
**the possessive of ''Joneses'' (meaning the people making up the Jones family) is pronounced ''Joneses'', so it is written ''Joneses' ''.

===Suffix===
#Used to form the plurals of [[numeral]]s, [[letter]]s, some [[abbreviation]]s and some nouns, usually because the omission of an apostrophe would make the meaning unclear or ambiguous.
#:''There are four 3's in my phone number."
#:''"Banana" has three a's and one b.'' (apostrophe ''s'' used so that the plural of "a" is not confused with the word "as")
#:''You can buy CD's in that shop.''
#:''These are the do's and don'ts.'' (apostrophe ''s'' used as "dos" may be misread)
#(''incorrectly'') Used to form the plural of nouns that correctly take just an ''s'' in the plural.  See '''[[greengrocer's apostrophe]]'''.
#:''Apple's 50p a pound''

====Usage notes====
*The use of '' 's'' to form plurals is to be avoided except when the meaning would be unclear.  The following are preferable:
**3s, CDs
*However, ''do's'' is commonly seen, and the plurals of letters, especially of lower-case "a" and "i", are best written with an apostrophe to avoid confusion.
*The use of the apostrophe in any plural (as in "apple's") &mdash; the so-called "[[greengrocer's apostrophe]]" &mdash; is incorrect.
