===Usage notes===
*Usage of the possessive marker with words ending in ''s'' varies.  The final ''s'' is dropped after regular plurals.
**''the dog's tail'' but ''the dogs' tails.''
:and may or may not be dropped after words ending in ''s'', depending on one's pronunciation (see the rule of thumb below)
**''St. James's'' or ''St. James'''

*Irregular plurals with endings other than ''s'' always take '''s''.
**''the children's voices''

*Possessives can generally be recast using ''of the'', and this may be advisable if the contraction seems awkward or ambiguous (which is often the case in speech).
**''the tails of the dogs.''

*Traditionally, the possessive of the biblical name Jesus is written without a final ''s''.
**''Jesus' disciples''

*This may or may not apply to the Spanish [[given name]] Jesus.
**''This is Jesus Ramirez, and this is Jesus's wife.''

====Rule of thumb====
*An excellent rule of thumb for determining whether to add '' 's'' or an apostrophe alone is the following: '''If you add an ''s'' to the noun when pronouncing the possessive, add '' 's'' when writing the possessive; otherwise add only an apostrophe.'''  Examples:
**the possessive of ''dog'' is pronounced ''dogs'', so it is written as ''dog's'';
**the possessive of ''dogs'' is pronounced the same way, so it is written ''dogs' '';
**the possessive of ''James'' can be pronounced either ''Jameses'' or ''James'', so write ''James's'' or ''James' '' according to your pronunciation;
**the possessive of ''Joneses'' (meaning the people making up the Jones family) is pronounced ''Joneses'', so it is written ''Joneses' ''.
