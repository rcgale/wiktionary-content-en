Buggery is a old British term refering to the act of anal sex between men. It was commonly used during the 19th century. Its more common form was bugger. As in 'Go, bugger off!' Or 'That, sir, is a filthy bugger!'
The best example of the use of the term is the movie 'Yellowbeard'. The lead character uses the term all the time.
