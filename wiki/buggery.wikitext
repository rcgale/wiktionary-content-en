Buggery is a old British term refering to the act of anal sex between men. It was commonly used during the 19th century. Its more common form was bugger. As in 'Go, bugger off!' Or 'That, sir, is a filthy bugger!'
The best example of the use of the term is the movie 'Yellowbeard'. The lead character uses the term all the time.

== Etymology ==
The term ''buggery'' originated in medieval Europe as an insult used to describe the rumoured same-sex sexual practices of the heretics from the Buggre sect. This sect originated in medieval Bulgaria, where its followers were called ''bogomils'', but when they spread out of the country they were called ''buggres'' (from ethnonym Bulgars).
