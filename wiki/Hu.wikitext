'''hu,'''  a clipping from  "human" (like "flu" from "influenza") - a 3rd person 
gender-neutral pronoun.  It is pronounced [hju:] like "hu" in "human." Its 
brevity and morphological structure (one open syllable: a consonant + a 
vowel) make it similar to other 3rd person pronouns -- a typical, easily 
recognizable member of this class: '''he - she - hu.'''

The derivative forms of "hu": reflexive "huself," [ [hju:self], possessive "hus"
[hju:z], and objective "hu" [hju:].

     Thus the five forms of the 3rd person pronouns make up the
      table:

                 nom     gen (adj)      posses       acc          refl
                 ---      		 ---                 ---         ---           ----
     male      he        his              his           him         himself
     fem       she       her             hers         her          herself
     neut      hu         hus              hus          hu           huself

Examples:
          An employee may choose to cover only huself and hus child or any
         number of children.

        It's the vice-president's job to support the president and take hus
         place when hu is away.

        A hero is one who places huself at risk for another.

        Hu that has ears to hear, let hu hear.

         It should be the chief aim of a university professor to
     exhibit huself in hus own true character - that is, as an ignorant
     human thinking, actively utilising hus small share of knowledge.

         An introvert can easily become an extrovert when it is
     advantageous for hu to do so.
