'''Gay For The Stay''' a phrase describing a normaly heterosexual person who engages in homosexual sex acts when segregated from the opposite sex. The phrase is normally used in a jail or prison setting, but it can also be applied to a gender segregated school. It is more common among female inmates than male inmates. 

In the magazine FEMME FATALE [[Heidi Fleiss]] discusses her experiences:

�I had my lovergirl. She looked like J.LO, but she was the boss. I was gay for the stay. She would be like, �Cook lunch! Wash those dishes!� I still send her money - how�s that? She�s doing 25 years.�


While "gay for the stay" can be applied to men or women in any gender segregated setting, the anacronym LURD applies only to incarcerated females. LURD stands for "Lesbian Until Release Date." It is also a pun to suggest a heterosexual woman was lured into lesbian activity.
