===Adverb===

# [[yes]].

====Antonyms====

*[[ei#Finnish|ei]] (''and its other forms'')

====Usage====
'''Kyllä''' can be felt to be rather formal or stilted. When answering questions affirmatively, it's also possible to repeat the word &ndash; usually a verb &ndash; used for the question.
:''Kävitkö eilen teatterissa?'' &mdash; ''Kävin.''
:"Did you go to the theatre yesterday?" &mdash; "Yes."

Colloquially, words like [[joo#Finnish|joo]] and [[juu#Finnish|juu]] are used for affirmative answers.
