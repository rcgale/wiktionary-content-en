*'''1954:''' ''"Sam drew a deep breath. ‘An '''Oliphaunt''' it was!’ he said. ‘So there are '''Oliphaunts''', and I have seen one. What a life! But no one at home will ever believe me. Well, if that's over, I'll have a bit of sleep.’"'' —[[w:J.R.R. Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[w:The Two Towers (book)|The Two Towers]], "Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit"
*'''1955:''' ''"The hobbits wandered here and there visiting again the places that they had passed before; and Sam hope always in some shadow of the woods or secret glade to catch, maybe, a glimpse of the great '''Oliphaunt'''. And when he learned at the siege of Gondor there had been a great number of these beasts but that they were all destroyed, he thought it a sad loss."'' -[[w:J.R.R. Tolkien|J.R.R.
