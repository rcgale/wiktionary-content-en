The [[English language|English]] [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] [[prefix]] '''be-''' is a hold over
from [[Old English]]. For the majority of [[native speaker|native speakers]] the prefix ''be-'' is no longer
[[productive]]; a possible exception to this is presented by the word ''besmitten'',
which numerous speakers seem to have recreated [http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bes2.htm].
Meanings and uses of ''be-'' include: thoroughly, excessively, or more generally,
it is used as an [[intensifier]]; on, around, over, or indicating some sort of
contact; it is also used to form transitive verbs from nouns (befriend,
behead, benight), adjectives (bedim, bewet) or otherwise intransitive verbs (bewail, beweep).
