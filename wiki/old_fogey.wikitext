'''Old fogey''' used to describe someone as a bit old fashioned: out of touch with modern things. 

In 1811 an [[Old Fogey]] was a nick name for an invalid, wounded soldier; derived from the French word fougeux, fierce or fiery. The modern sense has changed the use a little, but there is still the element of invalid in the saying.

'''''Young fogey''''' was humorously applied in a British context to some younger-generation but rather buttoned-down writers and journalists &mdash; examples being [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]] and (for a while) [[A. N. Wilson]]. The term is attributed to [[Alan Watkins]] writing in 1984 in ''[[The Spectator]]''.
