Kecapi is a group of string instruments which are plucked, and the suling is a javan flute made of bamboo. Kecapi Suling is an instrumental and improvisational form of music which is a lot mellower than the gamelan orchestras of the same region. The style is known for the chromatic scales and accidental notes that are used, and the music is polyphonic (There are a number of different melodies and harmonies complementing eachother).
It can sound very melodic- Especially the Suling flute.
