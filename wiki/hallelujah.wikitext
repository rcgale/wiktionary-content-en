===Quotations===
*So sung they, and the empyrean rung With Hallelujahs. - [[Milton]]
*But I reserve my hallelujahs for the St. Louis pork ribs (half slab, $13/ full slab, $18.95) and the baby back ribs ($15.99, half/ $22.95, full), which were just as Smoky said they should be--tenderly succulent, with meat that pulls from the bone with minimal effort, but hasn't lost its texture from overcooking. &mdash; Lorraine Gengo in [http://www.fairfieldweekly.com/gbase/Dining/content?oid=oid:106817 Rib Religion], Fairfield County Weekly, April 7, 2005
