Pula

#Penis [etymology: maybe it comes from Latin word "ampulla" which means something swollen (e.g. bottle, phial) ]
Unfortunately and despite his age, in modern Romanian language, "pula" is considered a derogatory word.

-''Romanian dictionaries don't show the word "pula" or, if this word is presented, its etymology is shown to be from the Latin word "pullus" (chicken).''

-''A theory says that "pula" is a Dacian word and it has older roots than Latin language:''

''pesnis - pennis - penis - '''Latin'''''

''pesnis - pennis - pelnis - pellis - pula - '''Romanian''' (unconvincing theory)''
