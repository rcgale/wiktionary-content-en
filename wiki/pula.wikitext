Pula
#Penis [etymology: maybe it comes from Latin word "ampula" which means something swollen (e.g. bottle, phial) ]
Unfortunately and despite his age, in modern Romanian language, "pula" is considered a derogatory word.

 Romanian dictionaries don't show the word "pula" or, if this word is present, its etymology is presented to be from Latin word "pulus" (chicken).
