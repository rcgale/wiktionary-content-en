==English==

===Noun===
# A planned event at which members of a past [[school class]] meet.
#: ''The class of 1986 is having its 20th class reunion before too long.''

===Usage note===
The ordinal number refers to the number of years since graduation, not to the number of reunions.  In the US at least, reunions at 5-year intervals are common, particularly 5th, 10th, 20th and 25th.
