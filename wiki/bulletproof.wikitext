Something is said to be '''bulletproof''' if it cannot be broken or is very tough. This concept usually applies to ideas; if a material is said to be bulletproof it usually means that literally it can withstand a direct shot by a bullet fired from a gun. So "a bulletproof window" is expected to protect someone behind it from gunfire, but a "bulletproof idea" is one that doesn't have any obvious flaws and is likely to succeed.
