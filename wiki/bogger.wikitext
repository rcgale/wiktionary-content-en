'''Bogger'' is an [[Ireland|Irish]] insulting term for someone not from a city. Under other circumstances, it can be extended to refer to those not from [[The Pale]], or even more tightly, to those not from [[Dublin]]. 

''Boggers'' are usually thought of as stupid, backwards, and slow to adapt to change. The word comes from [[bog]], the marsh-like [[peat]]-baring wastelands that make up much of the Irish countryside. Phrases have also developed off the term, including ''Bog Shopping Day'', refering to the [[December 8th|8th of December]], a traditional [[Catholic]] holiday, and the day on which people from the countryside would traditionally make their annual visit to [[Dublin]] to do their Christmas shopping. The reason for this was that schools and businesses in country areas did (and still do) close on this day, whereas those in Dublin did not.
