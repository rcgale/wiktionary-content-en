====Usage note====
*The word formed by combining the Latin prefix for the name of an integer n (n > 1) with this suffix may mean 1,000,000<sup>n</sup> or 1000<sup>n + 1</sup>, depending on national practices.  Hence ''billion'' can mean "million million" or "thousand million".  See the usage notes at [[Wiktionary Appendix:Numbers|Wiktionary's appendix on numbers]] and [[billion]] for more information.
