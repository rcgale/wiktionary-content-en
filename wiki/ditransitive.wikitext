'''ditransitive'''
#(''Linguistics'') Relating to a class of verbs which take both an object and an indirect object in the unmarked form. The most prototypical example is 'give', which entails a giver ([[subject]]), a gift ([[direct object]]) and a receiver ([[indirect object]]).
#:Note: It is postulated that in some languages there are so-called 'tritransitive verbs'. The best candidate in English would be 'transfer', i.e. "'''I''' transfered '''money''' from '''my account''' to '''yours'''".
