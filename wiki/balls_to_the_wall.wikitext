==English==
=== Etymology ===
This phrase was coined before or during [[WWII|World War Two]] by American [[aircraft]] pilots. The [[throttle]] levers, or [[accelerators]] in the aircraft had round tops, that looked like. To put the "balls to the wall" was to advance the levers all the way forward, making the aircraft fly as fast as possible (the wall was the [[firewall]] in the aircraft). It now means to carry out an action as quickly as possible.
