Pizda
#Female genitalia, especially external genitalia - vulva [etymology: maybe it comes from Baltic or Slavic languages; in these languages "pizda" has same meaning]

''Romanian dictionaries don't show the word "pizda" but, if this word is present, its etymology is shown to be from the Slavonic language.''
