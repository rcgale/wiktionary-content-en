The only extracurricular activity in which taking off your pants and running around like an idiot is acceptable.  Often preceded by weeks at "band camp," which is a form of cruel and unusual punishment often disguised as a "bonding activity" and led by ex-marines.  Push-ups and laps are normal forms of punishment.  Campers often come home an unnatural shade of red, due to severe overexposure to the sun which occurs while standing on a field staring at the leader for approximately eight hours at a stretch.  This leader often goes by the title of "band director," but those in the know realize that this is just a misinterpretation of "evil nazi fascist dictator."
