===Etymology===
From the earlier form ''an't'', an abbreviation of ''are not''.  The supposition that the original meaning of ''ain't'' was ''am not'' is a myth.  Historically, it was actually present in many dialects of the English language except the dialect of Southwest England that became the official standard.

===Contraction===
*'''Ain't''' is highly colloquial and often considered to betray a lack of education.
