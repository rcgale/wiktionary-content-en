==English==
===Etymology===
From the earlier form '''[[an't|an’t]]''', a contraction of “are not”.  The supposition that the original meaning of “ain’t” was “am not” is a myth.  Historically, it was present in many dialects of the English language except that of southeast England, which became the standard.

===Contraction===
'''ain’t''' ''slang in all senses''

# [[are]] [[not]], [[aren't|aren’t]].
# [[is]] not, [[isn't|isn’t]].
# [[am]] not.
# [[have]] not, [[haven't|haven’t]].
# [[has]] not, [[hasn't|hasn’t]].

====Usage note====

*This word is slang and often considered to betray a lack of education.
