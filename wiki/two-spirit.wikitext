'''Berdache''' (from [[French language|French]], from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''bardajo'') is a generic term used by some for a [[third gender]] (woman-living-man) among many, if not most, [[Native American]] tribes. There are terms for these individuals in the various Native American languages, and the term "berdache" is frequently rejected as inappropriate and offensive by Native Americans.

These individuals were often viewed as having two spirits.  Their dress was usually mixture of male and female articles.  They had distinct gender and social roles in their tribes.  For instance, there was one ceremony during the [[Sun Dance]] that was performed only by a member of this group. (See [[winkte]].)
