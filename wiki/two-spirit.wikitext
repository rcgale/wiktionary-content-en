Berdache (from French, from Arabic ''bardajo'') is a generic term used for a third gender (woman-living-man) among many, if not most, [[Native American]] tribes.

Each tribe obviously had their own term for it. 
*Winkte (Navajo)

They were often viewed as having two spirits.

Their dress was usually mixture of male and female articles.

They had distinct roles in their tribes.
There was one ceremony during the Sun Dance (Plains Indian tribe, don't remember which) that was performed only by a berdache.
