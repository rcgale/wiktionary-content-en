'''Berdache''' (from [[French language|French]], from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''bardajo'' meaning "kept boy") is a generic term used primarily by anthropologists for a [[third gender]] (woman-living-man) among many, if not most, [[Native American]] tribes. There are terms for these individuals in the various Native American languages and the term "berdache" is frequently rejected as inappropriate and offensive by Native Americans. Many prefer the term '''Two-Spirit''', which usually implies a man spirit and a woman spirit living in the same body.

These individuals are often viewed as having two spirits occupying one body.  Their dress is usually a mixture of traditionally male and traditionally female articles.  They have distinct gender and social roles in their tribes.  For instance, among the Lakota there was one ceremony during the [[Sun Dance]] that was performed only by a two-spirited person of that tribe. (See [[winkte]].)

Two-Spirit individuals perform specific social functions in their communities. Some are counselors while others are medicine persons or spiritual functionaries. They study skills including story telling, theater, magic, hypnotism, healing, herbal medicine, ventriloquism, singing, music and dance.

The word "berdache," though not universal, is most often used by anthropologists today to signify a traditional cross-gendered "male" performing an important function (perhaps, but not always, spiritual in nature) in any society from Native American (with the above semantic caveat) to Siberian to Island-Pacific.

Some examples of Two-Spirits in history include the accounts by Spanish conquistadors who spotted a two-spirited individual(s) in almost every village they entered in Central America and whom they then murdered. The Hopis used to hold a ritual in which a 16 year old male-bodied Two-Spirit was dressed as the Corn Goddess. All the men of the village then performed anal sex with this individual in order to bring fertility to the corn crop for the year. Subsequently a huge feast was held in the youth's honor.

There are descriptions of Two-Spirit individuals having strong mystical powers. In one account, warring braves of a rival tribe ride up to attack a group of foraging women when they perceive that one of the women, the one that does not run away, is a Two-Spirit. They halt their attack and retreat after the Two-Spirit counters them with a stick, determining that the Two-Spirit will have great power which they will not be able to overcome.

The (Peigan) [[Blackfeet|Blackfoot]] do not have well documented male-bodied Two-Spirits, but they do have "manly-hearted women" (Lewis, 1941) who act in much of the social roles of men, including willingness to sing alone, usually considered "immodest," and using a men's singing style. (Nettl, 1989, p.84, 125).

Alternate spellings are "Two Spirit" and "Twospirit."
