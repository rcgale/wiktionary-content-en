'''Berdache''' (from [[French language|French]], from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''bardajo'' meaning "kept boy") is a generic term used by some for a [[third gender]] (woman-living-man) among many, if not most, [[Native American]] tribes. There are terms for these individuals in the various Native American languages, and the term "berdache" is frequently rejected as inappropriate and offensive by Native Americans, many of whom prefer '''Two-Spirit''', which usually implies a man spirit, and a woman spirit, living in the same body.

These individuals are often viewed as having two spirits, and two sexes, at the same time.  Their dress is usually mixture of male and female articles.  They have distinct gender and social roles in their tribes.  For instance, there was one ceremony during the [[Sun Dance]] that was performed only by a member of this group. (See [[winkte]].)

Two-spirit individuals perform specific social functions in their communities. Some are counselors, therapists of sorts, while others are shamans or spiritual functionaries. They study skills including story telling, theater, magic, hypnotism, healing, herbal medicine, ventriloquism, singing, music and dance.

The word "berdache", though not universal, is most often used today to signify a traditional cross gendered "male" performing in a shamanic function in any society from Native American (with the above semantic caveat) to Siberian to Island-Pacific.

Some examples of Berdache or Two-Spirit tradition in history include the  Spanish conquistadors who met a two spirit shaman in every village they entered in Central America and whom they then killed. The Hopis used to hold a ritual in which a 16 year old boy was dressed as the Corn Goddess. All the men of the village then performed anal sex with him in order to bring fertility to the corn crop for the year. Subsequently a huge feast was held in the youth's honor.

There are descriptions of two-spirit individuals having strong mystical powers. In one account, warring braves of a rival tribe ride up to attack a group of foraging women when they perceive that one of the women, the one that does not run away, is a two-spirit. They halt their attack and retreat after the two-spirit counters them with a stick, determining that the two-spirit will have great power which they will not be able to overcome.

Today, groups of cross gendered male bodied persons have picked up the tradition of the two-spirit and put them into practice. These groups include the [[Radical Fairies]], the [[Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence]] and others.

The (Piegan) [[Blackfeet|Blackfoot]] do not have well documented male Two-Spirits, but they do have "manly-hearted women" (Lewis, 1941) who act in much of the social roles of men, including willingness to sing alone, usually considered "immodest", and using a men's singing style. (Nettl, 1989, p.84, 125).

Alternate spellings are "Two Spirit" and "Twospirit."
