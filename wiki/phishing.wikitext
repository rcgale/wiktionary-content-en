===Noun===
'''phishing''' (''uncountable'')

# (''computing'') The act of sending [[email]] that falsely claims to be from a legitimate organisation.  This is usualy combined with a threat that an account will close, a balance is do, or information is missing from their account.  It will request a recipient to supply confidential information, such as bank account details, [[PIN]]s or [[password]]s; these details are then used by the owners of the website to conduct [[fraud]].

These attacks have been documented against many major corporations.  It's better to err on the side of caution.  Don't trust websites and phone numbers provided in the email or webpage, as they can eaisly be [[spoofed]].  These emails can be the result of [[criminal]]s and [[virus]]es.

Find a previous printed statement, or contact by alternate means.  To confirm the details in the email, and ask someone in person, or over the phone (use a well established contact number).  Research the company to see what their policies and guidelines are regarding notices of that nature.  Forward a copy (if they agree) to their customer service division with complete headers.  You can also search the internet for keywords in the email to see if others have reported it.
