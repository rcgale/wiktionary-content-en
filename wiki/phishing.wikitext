<!-- This advice is useful but does not add to the definition and so does not belong in Wiktionary, in my opinion.  I am replacing it with a link to the Wikipedia page, which includes similar information -- [[User:Paul G|Paul G]] 09:36, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC)

These attacks have been documented against many major corporations.  It's better to err on the side of caution.  Don't trust websites and phone numbers provided in the email or webpage, as they can easily be [[spoofed]].  These emails can be the result of [[criminal]]s and [[virus]]es.

Find a previous printed statement, or contact by alternate means.  To confirm the details in the email, and ask someone in person, or over the phone (use a well established contact number).  Research the company to see what their policies and guidelines are regarding notices of that nature.  Forward a copy (if they agree) to their customer service division with complete headers.  You can also search the internet for keywords in the email to see if others have reported it.
