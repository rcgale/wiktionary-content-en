To '''churn''' is to agitate rapidly and repetitively, or to stir with a rowing or rocking motion. 

Used literally, it generally applies to liquids, notably [[cream]], which is churned to produce [[butter]]. 

It can also be used figuratively, with the meaning of producing excessive and sometimes undesirable or unproductive activity or motion. The figurative meaning has been applied to [[stock]] transactions related to [[mutual fund]]s. It describes a situation in which the fund managers move the money of their investors rapidly from one stock to another, taking a fee for each transaction out of the fund, but not necessarily increasing the value of the investment portfolio substantially. This is called '''churning''' the fund portfolio.

'''Churn''' is also a noun indicating a vessel used for churning, as in ''butter churn''.
