===Etymology===
From Middle English '''they''' < Old Norse '''[[þeir]]''' (those) < Proto-Germanic '''[[*thai]]''' (those), < Proto-Indo-European pronomial base '''[[*to-]]''' (that).

===Pronunciation===
*[[w:AHD|AHD]]: /<i>th</i>ā/
*[[w:IPA|IPA]]: /ðeɪ/
*[[w:SAMPA|SAMPA]]: /DeI/

===[[Personal pronoun]]===
The third person, nominative case, usually plural, but sometimes used in the singular when the gender is unknown or irrelevant.
(''Objective case'': [[them]], ''possessive'': [[their]], ''possessive noun''; [[theirs]], ''reflexive'': [[themselves]] (plural) [[themself]] (singular).)

# The third person plural '''they''' refers to a group of others.
#:''Fred and Jane? They just arrived.''
# The third person singular ''they'' refers to a single person of unknown or irrelevant gender. '''Usage note:''' this usage is informal and is regarded as incorrect in written English by many style guides and usage commentators.
#:''Have you ever seen someone while they are on their deathbed?''
# An indefinite pronoun having a vague meaning of "people" or "some people".
#:''They say it's a good place to live.''
#:''They didn't have computers in the old days.''
#:''They should do something about this.''
*Another indefinite pronoun is [[one]], but the two words do not mean the same and are rarely interchangeable.
