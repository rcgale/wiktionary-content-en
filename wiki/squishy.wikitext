{{cleanup}}
==English==

===Adjective===

Having the quality of being soft under compression, usually referring to something consisting of a liquid (e.g. a sponge).

The quality of being ''squishy'' can be discovered by the action of squeezing.  If the object ''squishes'' (i.e. yields in a wet manner), than the action of ''squeezing'' could have been referred to as ''squishing''.

''Squishy'' has connotations of being yielding in policy or overflowing with emotions (literally tears).
