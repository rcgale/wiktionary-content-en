===Usage note===
'''Squishy''' is often used of a wet or object or substance that may emit some of the liquid it contains when pressed.  Hence a sponge or mud may be described as squishy.  The object or substance need not be wet but must yield easily to pressure; hence [[foam rubber]] or [[fat]] on a person's body may also be described as squishy.
