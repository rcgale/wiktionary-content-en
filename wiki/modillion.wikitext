===Quotations===
'''1922:''' The familiar classic console or modillion is an example: although in general contour it is well adapted to its function as a supporting bracket, embedded in, and projecting from a wall, yet the scroll-like ornament with which its sides are embellished gives it the appearance of not entering the wall at all, but of being stuck against it in some miraculous manner. &mdash; Claude Fayette Bragdon in ''The Beautiful Necessity: Seven Essays on Theosophy and Architecture'', Essay II, ''Unity and Polarity''
