'''Cytopathy''' is the [[disease]] or [[disorder]] of a [[cell]], or of the structures contained within a cell. Cytopathy comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word "kytos" meaning "a hollow cell," and the Greek word "pathos" meaning "suffering." The two words combined thus mean "suffering (of) a hollow cell."
