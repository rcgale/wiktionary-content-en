===Etymology===
{{L.}} ''[[plus]]'' [[more]] + ''[[perfectus]]'' [[perfect]].

===Noun===
'''[[pluperfect]] [[tense]]'''
# (''[[Grammar]]'', of a [[verb]]): Tense of verb conjugated by adding ''[[had]]'' before the [[past participle]] of a verb.
#: Examples: 
#:: ''I'' '''''had''''' ''finished my homework, so I watched TV.''
#:: ''He only started learning to play guitar after he '''had''' heard [[:w:Jimmy Hendrix|Hendrix]] play.''

====Usage====
This tense is used when referring to something that happened '''before''' another past event, mentioned in the same sentence, happened.  In the first example above, ''I had finished'' is the pluperfect part, as it was an event that finished happening before the later event (the watching of TV) started.
