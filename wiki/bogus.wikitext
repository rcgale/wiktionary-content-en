===Etymology===
First attested from [[w:1797|1797]], as [[underworld]] term for [[counterfeit]] coins. Meaning of the machine (known as a [[bogus press]]) was first attested [[w:1828|1828]]. Sense of phony paper money as well as a general adjective applied to anything, being less valuable than it first appeared was first attested [[w:1848|1848]]. Later, the word was applied to anything of poor quality. The current use to mean [[useless]] is probably from the slang of [[computer hacker]]s.

The origin is unknown, but there are at least two theories that try to trace its origin:
*From Hausa [[boko]], ''to fake''. Since [[bogus]] first appeared in America, this may be possible that its ancestor was brought here on a slave ship.
*From criminal slang as a short form of [[tantrabogus]], a 19th century slang term for a menacing object, making some believe that [[bogus]] might be linked to [[bogy]] or [[bogey]] (see [[bogeyman]]).
