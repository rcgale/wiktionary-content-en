==English==
===Etymology===
From '''[[pale]]''', a region held by one nation in another country; hence suggesting that anything outside their control was uncivilised.
<!-- Dubious - possibly folklore
# In middle ages, the city of [[w:Dublin | Dublin]], Ireland was an English [[enclave]] in Ireland.  It was defended by a fence, called a pale.  (The world ''paling'', a facing panel of a fence, is the only remnant of this word.).  People who lived outside the fence, the native Irish, were regarded as [[uncouth]] by the English.  (The feeling was mutual!).  Consequently, if someone behaved incorrectly, their behaviour was like that of the Irish and thus 'beyond the pale'.
