'''Atelier''' is a term used colloquially to refer to a [[fashion house]].  In [[French language|French]] it means 'workshop' or 'studio.' It can also be used to refer to any place of creative construction but more often, is in reference to [[haute couture]] fashion studios or artist studios.

Ateliers were particularly important in the French art movements of the 15th century and later.  More than just a studio, ateliers were also galleries of art that could receive considerable interest from the public. They could also refer to all the students and assistants of the artist.  Opening an atelier was a sign of some success, and there was tremendous competition to get into the ateliers of "art stars" such as [[Hans Makart]].
