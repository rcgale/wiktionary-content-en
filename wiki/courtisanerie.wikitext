Courtisanerie is any action taken by a group of courtiers. 

Derived from the French word courtisan(e), a member of "La Cour", meaning the group of vassals, public servants, sycophants, (and generally hangers-on and/or prostitutes), congregating around a baron, a king, or an emperor. 

It should be noted that the French "Cour" also generically means an open air area used for meetings and enclosed by buildings, like castles or, today, apartment or farm buildings. 

In the modern era, the word has been absorbed into English as "courtesan" and used as a euphemism for what could be termed a very discreet and high class prostitute, so "Courtisanerie" could be used in English to describe the action of a group of courtesans. 

This term is not, today at least, in common use in France. 

As an interesting aside, the game of tennis was derived from earlier ball games, (Jeu de Paume: Game of the palm of the hand), and distinguished by the use of paddles or racquets (first used by "English" kings and noblemen, soon after the French invasion and conquest in early medieval times), in a "cour" of their palaces, from which "tennis court" must have sprung.
