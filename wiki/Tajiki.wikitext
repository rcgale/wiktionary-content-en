The name Soviets chose to use for the Persian language in Central-Asia. Tajiki-Persian is actually the same language as Persian but with small dialectical variations. Persian is the official langugae of Tajikistan, were it is officially called Tajiki-Persian today.
Tajik was written in Perso-Arabic script until the early 1900s. In 1928, the Roman alphabet was introduced, and used until it was replaced by the Cyrillic alphabet in 1940. A modified Cyrillic alphabet was in use until 1994. Recently, the Tajiki government has attempted to return to a Roman alphabet.
