According to Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation, free software is software that everyone is [[free]] to copy, redistribute and modify. That implies it must be available as [[source code]]. It does not imply that it is free of charge, so anyone can sell free software so long as they don't impose any new restrictions on its redistribution or use.

[[wiktionary|This dictionary]] is free in this sense, though it is not really software.

There are many other kinds of "free software" in the more obvious sense of "free of charge".
