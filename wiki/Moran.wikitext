=== Etymology ===
There are two alternatives for the family name:
* From {{E.}} and {{F.}} [[morant]] "steadfast"
* Anglicization of {{Ir.}} [[Ó'Mórain]] "big" or [[Ó'Mughráin]]
The place name may in some cases be derived from the family name, the places being named after people with the family name.
