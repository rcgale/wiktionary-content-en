====Usage notes====
<!-- Changes made here should be reflected in the "Usage note" for LESS -->
The difference between ''less'' and ''[[fewer]]'' is that the former refers to an amount, while the latter refers to a numbered quantity of undivided items.  Much confusion exists around these two terms, in part due to the fact that they share the same antonym: ''[[more]]''.

'''Less''' is correctly used with:
*Uncountable nouns, such as ''water'', ''time'' or ''patience'', as in "She has '''less''' patience than he does."
*Plural nouns that define a number of measurement units (particularly those relating to time, distance, or amount), as in "he had to wait '''less''' than ten minutes," "this coat cost '''less''' than ten dollars," "he won by '''less''' than five percent of the vote," and "he would settle for no '''less''' than 3.5 gallons of the highest-grade milk."  It is acceptable to use ''fewer'' in these cases as well, but the meaning is slightly altered, because ''fewer'' emphasizes the atomicity of the unit.  ''Less than five minutes'' could be, for example, four minutes and 59 seconds.  ''Fewer than five minutes'', on the other hand, would be, at most, four minutes.

With regular plural nouns ''fewer'' is considered to be the correct form, though it is common in casual writing and speech to use ''less''.  While some people would correct the statements "'''less''' than 3,000 people attended the rally," "there are '''less''' cars on the road today," and "please try to ask '''less''' questions," they are not atypical.
