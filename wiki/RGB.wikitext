'''RGB''' 
# '''Red, Green, Blue'''; the colors output from a typical cathode-ray tube (i.e. an old computer monitor) used in varying combinations to render all colors.  <!--Encyclopedic content that I'm too lazy to go over to Wikipedia and enter right now: Later, a coding convention (especially in HTML) used to specify the intensity of each of the three components needed to render a specific color.  For example, bgcolor="#ffffff" means a background color of white - red at hexadecimal FF or decimal 255, green at FF, and blue at FF.  In video display rendering, each pixel then has three bytes of information describing their intensity, thereby determining exactly how much video memory is then required.  256 ^ 3 ~= 16 million discrete colors that can then be displayed at any given pixel.)  -->
