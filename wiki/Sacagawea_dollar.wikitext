A truth that sounds like a lie.  E.g. when an older sister tells a younger sister that the US Mint is making new dollar coins featuring Sacagawea and is going to give them away in Cheerios boxes.  The younger sister responds "do not lie to me you lying liar" but it is true.

For true Sacagawea dollaring there must be the threat of abuse of power.
