'''Dorey'''

A word of unsual origin and derived from the old-Basque ''Dhoreks'' and the Breton ''Dhoreagh''.

Often mispronounced as ''Doh ray'' as in the English musical scale notation of [[do-ray-me-fa-so-lah-tee]] which marks incomers into a community in [[Basqueland]], or the smaller enclave of the Clan Dorey of the Channel Islands with contemptuous ridicule.
