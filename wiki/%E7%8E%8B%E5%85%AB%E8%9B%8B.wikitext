Wang Ba Dan (&#29579;&#20843;&#26086;) is an extremely offensive chinese word. It literally means "turtle egg" but normally means "bastard" or "selfish person". It is more widespread by the older chinese people (30-80 yrs.) as younger people use "Bai jia zer" more often. It is very common in most parts of China.
