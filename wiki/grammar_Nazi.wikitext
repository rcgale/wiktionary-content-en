'''[[Grammar]] [[Nazi]]''' is a derogatory term used to describe participants in a discussion (online or otherwise) who are more concerned with correcting others' grammar than in the substance of the discussion itself.  Those who concentrate on commenting about spelling errors may be called "spelling Nazis."

The term can frequently be seen in [[Slashdot]] discussions.
