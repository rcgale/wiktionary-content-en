'''Grammar Nazi''', '''Spelling Nazi''', and '''Language Nazi''' are all derogatory terms used to describe participants in a discussion (online or otherwise) who criticize or correct the language usage of other participants. These terms are often associated with accusations that the person is [[flaming]] by finding fault with minor details of other participants' messages. Participants in these discussions often end up taking opposite sides in the [[Prescription and description| prescriptive/descriptive]] debate.

As [[English language|English]] spelling is quite difficult, and spelling errors commonplace, it is very easy to find a mistake in a message that one can cling to in order to be a "Spelling Nazi". In other languages with more regular spelling, other grammatical features might be used, as the [[subjunctive mood]] or placement of [[diacritic]]s in [[Italian language|Italian]].
