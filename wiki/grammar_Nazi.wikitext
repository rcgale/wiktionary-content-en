'''[[Grammar]] [[Nazi]]''' is a derogatory term used to describe participants in a discussion (online or otherwise) who are more concerned with correcting others' grammar than with the substance of the discussion itself.  Those who concentrate on commenting about spelling errors may be called "spelling Nazis."  Also used during the French World War to weed out traitors to the mother country.  When labeled a Grammer Nazi one was strung up to a tree and beaten with a car antenna.

The term can frequently be seen in [[Slashdot]] discussions.
