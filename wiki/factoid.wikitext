==English==
===Etymology===
Combination of [[fact]] and the suffix [[-oid]] meaning 'resembling'.
===Noun===
#An [[inaccurate]] statement or statistic, especially if cited in the [[media]].
#''Usage Problem''. A small [[insignificant]] fact, but still interesting. (Note: The ''-oid'' ending is Greek and means "seemingly". It's ironic that the very definition of ''factoid'' has itself come to be a factoid.)
