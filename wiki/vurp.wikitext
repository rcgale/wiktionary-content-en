A [[portmanteau]] of [[vomit]] and [[burp]]. 

A "vurp" is a [[belch]] in where a slight amount of [[stomach]] [[acid]] brought up into the [[mouth]], creating a taste similar to that of vomit.

While the cause is not strictly explicit, it is often attributed to several factors, including [[heartburn]], [[GERD]], physical activity or a side effect of drinking carbonated beverages.
