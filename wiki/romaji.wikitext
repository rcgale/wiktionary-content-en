===Etymology===
From Japanese [[ローマ字]] [''roman letters''].

===Noun===
'''romaji''' ([[uncountable]])

# Any system of transliterating [[Japanese]] into [[Latin]].
# A normal system of transliterating [[Japanese]] into [[Latin]] that doesn't focus on pronunciation. However, this system really has no standard; seeing things like ''tu'' written '''tsu''', or even long vowels shortened is common. (This usually only happens to abide by an already known transliteration.)
