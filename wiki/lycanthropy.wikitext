'''lycanthropy'''

#Lycanthropy is the fictitious disease that the most prominent lycanthropes, the [[werewolf|werewolves]], have. Lycanthropes [[shapeshift]] into the form of an [[animal]] on a full moon. According to different traditions of mythology, the lycanthrope either turns into that animal, or retains human features, such as walking on two legs. 

The myth possibly originates from the disease [[w:lupus erythematosus|lupus erythematosus]], which causes those afflicted to grow extra hair and to shun sunlight. "Lupus" is Latin for "wolf". It is possible that the vampire myth has a similar origin.

===Etymology===

The term comes from [[ancient Greek]] ''lykanthropos'' (λυκανθροπος): lykos ("wolf") + anthropos ("man").
