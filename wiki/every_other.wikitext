===Pronoun===
<!-- ===Indefinite article=== -> <!-- or is it? -->
<!-- unlikely to be an indefinite article - only "a" and "an" have that name; probably an adjective -- [[User:Paul G|Paul G]] 09:40, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC) -->

# All except for some previously mentioned set.
#: ''Two of the bolts were loose, but every other bolt I checked was fine.''
# [[Every]] second; each alternate; the second of each pair in turn (''perhaps used because "every second" could also refer to "second" as a unit of time or be interpreted as meaning "only the second"'').  <!--"Every second" is correct, however - I have given this as a synonym -- [[User:Paul G|Paul G]] 09:40, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC) -->
#: ''Every other person in the line wore a pink bowtie.''
