== [[noun]] ==
# a minimum wage paying job with no benefits, usually a first job for young people who are just entering the job market. (Likely from the fact that McDonalds (R) is one of the jobs which many young people have as a first work experience, and by extension to any fast-food or service oriented employment which usually offer no health or other benefits and which pay low wages).
