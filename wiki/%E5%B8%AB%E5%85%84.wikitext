'''Sihing''' or '''Shixiong''' (&#24107;&#20804;) means senior fellow students in a Chinese martial art school.  Si means teacher.  Hing means elder brother.  The seniority is not based on the student's age or level of skill, but on the chronological order of following a particular [[sifu]].  The master's first student is always the most senior shihing.  The less senior students are called [[sidai]] among their peers.
