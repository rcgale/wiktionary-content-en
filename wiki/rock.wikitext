===Noun===
'''rock''' (plural [[rocks]])
#A reasonably small to moderate sized piece of [[stone]].
#Style of music characterized by basic drum-beat based, generally 4/4 riffs, based on (usually electric) guitar, drums, and vocals (generally with bass guitar). Originally a shortening of [[Rock and Roll]] but since adopting a slightly different meaning, as a simpler, more modern, metal-like genre, Rock and Roll generally left referring to earlier forms such as the nineteen-fifties, notably more swing-oriented style.
#(''Uncountable or mass noun'') The substance that stones are made of (whilst solid). (''The face of the cliff is solid rock.'')
# A large grassless hill or island.
#A type of hard [[candy]] in the form of a stick (UK).
#Someone who comforts another person.
#A swing forward or back.
#(slang, American): A crystalized lump of crack cocaine
