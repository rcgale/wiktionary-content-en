====Etymology====
'''willy, willie'''
Possibly a contraction of ''membrum virile'', a Latin term used in English in the nineteenth century.  However, it is also possible that ''willy'' is simply the use of a proper name in English (''Willy'' is a pet-name from ''William''); cf. the vulgar usage of ''dick'' and ''fanny'', which also derive from proper names.
