Hi my name is Shawn.

'''Zen''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: Zen, &#31109;; [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: [[Ch&aacute;n]], &#31146;; [[Korean language|Korean]]: Seon, &#49440;; [[Sanskrit]]: [[dhyana|dhy{{msg:a}}na]]) is a branch of [[Mahayana|{{msg:mahayana}}]] [[Buddhism]], practiced especially in [[Chinese Buddhism|China]], [[Japanese Buddhism|Japan]], and [[Korean Buddhism|Korea]] which incorporates [[Taoist]] thought. It stresses the role of [[meditation]] in pursuing [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]].  Because Zen is the name for this branch in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] as well as in [[English language|English]], this article will concern itself with both traditional Zen in Japan and with Zen as an international phenomenon.  For information specific to [[Asia]]n countries other than Japan, please follow the appropriate links below.

==Spread of Zen==

Traditionally, Zen traces its roots back to [[Indian Buddhism]], where it was known by "[[dhyana|dhy{{msg:a}}na]]", a [[Sanskrit]] term for meditation. This name was [[transliterate]]d into [[Chinese]] as ''[[Chan|Ch&aacute;n]]'' (&#31146;); "Ch&aacute;n" was later transliterated into [[Korean]] as ''[[Seon]]'', and then into Japanese as "Zen."

According to these traditional accounts, an Indian monk named [[Bodhidharma]] brought Zen Buddhism to [[China]] in the [[fifth century]] [[Common Era|CE]]. Later, [[Japan|Japanese]] monks studying in [[China]] learned of Zen and brought it back to Japan around the seventh century.

==Zen in Japan==

The following Zen traditions still exist in Japan: [[Rinzai]], [[Soto]], and [[Obaku School|Obaku]].  Originally formulated by the [[eponym]]ous Chinese master [[Linji]] (Rinzai in Japanese), the Rinzai school was introduced to [[Japan]] in [[1191]] by [[Eisai]]. [[Dogen]], who studied under Eisai, would later carry the [[Caodong]], or "Soto" Zen school to Japan from China.  Obaku was introduced in the 17th century by a [[Ingen]], a Chinese monk.

==Zen teachings and practices==

Zen teachings often criticize [[text]]ual [[Hermeneutics|study]] and [[praxeology|worldly]] [[action (philosophy)|action]], concentrating primarily on meditation in pursuit of an unmediated awareness of the processes of the world and the mind. However, these teachings are themselves also deeply rooted in the Buddhist textual tradition, drawing primarily on [[Mahayana|{{msg:mahayana}}]] sutras composed in India and China, and on the recorded teachings of masters in the various Zen traditions themselves.

===Zazen===

Zen meditation is called [[zazen]]. Zazen translates approximately to "sitting meditation", although it can be applied to practice in any posture. During zazen, practitioners usually assume a [[lotus position|lotus]], half-lotus, burmese, or seiza position. Rinzai practitioners typically sit facing the center of the room, while Soto practitioners sit facing a wall. Awareness is directed towards complete cognizance of one's posture and breathing. In this way, practitioners seek to transcend thought and be directly aware of the universe.

In Soto, [[shikantaza]] meditation, sometimes translated as "just-sitting," i.e., a meditation with no objects, anchors, "seeds," or content, is the primary form of practice. Considerable textual, philosophical, and phenomenological justification of this practice can be found in Dogen's Shobogenzo.

===Koan practice===
The Zen schools (especially but not exclusively Rinzai) also employ [[koan|koans]] (Japanese; Chinese: gongan; Korean: gong'an). The term is borrowed from that for a signpost used in ancient China, on which new laws were announced to the public. In much the same sense, a koan embodies a realized principle, or law of reality. Koans, which are often paradoxical are not meant to be apprehended rationally but rather to be realized in experience.

=="Zen" in Western pop-culture==

Many modern students have made the mistake of thinking that since much of Zen sounds like nonsense, especially in translation and out of context, any clever nonsense is also Zen. This is not the case, but see [[Discordianism]] and the [[Church of the SubGenius]] for modern semiserious religions influenced by this idea.
