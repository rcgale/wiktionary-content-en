'''Zen''' is the [[Japanese]] name of a well known branch of [[Mahayana|Mah&#257;y&#257;na]] [[Buddhism]], practiced especially in [[Chinese Buddhism|China]], [[Japanese Buddhism|Japan]], [[Vietnamese Buddhism|Vietnam]] and [[Korean Buddhism|Korea]]. It stresses the role of [[meditation]] in pursuing [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]].  Because Zen is the common name for this branch in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] as well as in [[English language|English]], this article will concern itself both with Zen as practiced in Japan and with Zen as an international phenomenon.  For information specific to [[Asia]]n countries other than Japan, please follow the appropriate links above.

==Spread of Zen==

Traditionally, Zen traces its roots back to [[Indian Buddhism]], where it was known by "[[dhyana|dhy&#257;na]]" (&#2343;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2344;), a [[Sanskrit]] term for meditation. This name was [[transliterate]]d into [[Chinese]] as ''[[Chan|Ch&aacute;n]]'' (&#31146;); "Ch&aacute;n" was later transliterated into [[Korean language|Korean]] as ''[[Seon]]'', and then into Japanese as "Zen."

According to these traditional accounts, an Indian monk named [[Bodhidharma]] brought Zen Buddhism to [[China]] in the [[5th century|fifth century]]. Later, [[Korea|Korean]] monks studying in [[China]] learned of Zen and spread it as far as [[Japan]] around the seventh century.

The following Zen traditions still exist in Japan: [[Rinzai]], [[Soto]], and [[Obaku School|Obaku]].  Originally formulated by the [[eponym]]ous Chinese master [[Linji]] (Rinzai in Japanese), the Rinzai school was introduced to [[Japan]] in [[1191]] by [[Eisai]]. [[Dogen]], who studied under Eisai, would later carry the [[Caodong]], or "Soto" Zen school to Japan from [[China]].  Obaku was introduced in the 17th century by [[Ingen]], a Chinese monk.

==Zen teachings and practices==

Zen teachings often criticize [[text]]ual [[Hermeneutics|study]] and the pursuit of wordly accomplishments, concentrating primarily on meditation in pursuit of an unmediated awareness of the processes of the world and the mind. Zen, however, is no mere quietistic doctrine: the Chinese Zen master [[Baizhang]] ([[720]]-[[814]] CE), ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ''Hyakujo''), left behind a famous saying which had been the guiding principal of his life, "A day without work is a day of no eating." When Hyakujo was thought to be too old to work in the garden, his devotees hid his gardening tools. In response to this, the master then refused to eat, saying "No working, no living." 

These teachings are in turn deeply rooted in the Buddhist textual tradition, drawing primarily on [[Mahayana|Mah&#257;y&#257;na]] sutras composed in India and China, particularly the [[Heart Sutra]], the [[Diamond Sutra]], the [[Lankavatara Sutra]], and the ''Samantamukha Parivarta'', a chapter of the [[Lotus Sutra]]. The body of Zen doctrine also includes the recorded teachings of masters in the various Zen traditions.

===Zazen===

Zen meditation is called [[zazen]]. Zazen translates approximately to "sitting meditation", although it can be applied to practice in any posture. During zazen, practitioners usually assume a [[lotus position|lotus]], half-lotus, burmese, or seiza position. Rinzai practitioners typically sit facing the center of the room, while Soto practitioners sit facing a wall. Awareness is directed towards complete cognizance of one's posture and breathing. In this way, practitioners seek to transcend thought and be directly aware of the universe.

In Soto, [[shikantaza]] meditation, sometimes translated as "just-sitting," i.e., a meditation with no objects, anchors, "seeds," or content, is the primary form of practice. Considerable textual, philosophical, and phenomenological justification of this practice can be found in Dogen's Shobogenzo.

===Koan practice===
The Zen schools (especially but not exclusively Rinzai) are associated with [[koan|koans]] (Japanese; Chinese: gongan; Korean: gong'an). The term originally referred to legal cases in [[Tang Dynasty|Tang-dynasty]] China. In some sense, a koan embodies a realized principle, or law of reality. Koans often appear paradoxical but are not meant to be apprehended rationally. Rather, Zen practitioners are said to recognize and actualize a koan in experience. An example of a Zen koan: "Two hands clap and there is a sound. What is the sound of one hand?". It's sometimes said that after diligent practice, the practitioner and the koan become one.

=="Zen" in Western pop-culture==

Many modern students have made the mistake of thinking that since much of Zen sounds like nonsense, especially in translation and out of context, any clever nonsense is also Zen. This is not the case, but see [[Discordianism]] and the [[Church of the SubGenius]] for modern semiserious religions influenced by this idea.
