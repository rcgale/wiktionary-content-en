{{buddhism}}
'''Zen''' is the [[Japanese]] name of a well known branch of [[Mahayana|Mah&#257;y&#257;na]] [[Buddhism]], practiced especially in [[Chinese Buddhism|China]], [[Japanese Buddhism|Japan]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Korean Buddhism|Korea]]. It stresses the role of [[meditation]] in pursuing [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]].  But besides this, it has been termed, by one Western commentator, "a way of life, work, and art ."  Because Zen is the common name for this branch in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] as well as in [[English language|English]], this article will concern itself both with Zen as practiced in Japan and with Zen as an international phenomenon.  For information specific to [[Asia]]n countries other than Japan, please follow the appropriate links above.

==Spread of Zen==

Traditionally, Zen traces its roots back to [[Indian Buddhism]], where it was known by "[[dhyana|dhy&#257;na]]" (&#2343;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2344;), a [[Sanskrit]] term for meditation. This name was [[transliterate]]d into [[Chinese]] as ''[[Chan|Ch&aacute;n]]'' (&#31146;); "Ch&aacute;n" was later transliterated into [[Korean language|Korean]] as ''[[Seon]]'', [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] as ''[[Thien]]'' and then into Japanese as "Zen."

According to these traditional accounts, an Indian monk named [[Bodhidharma]] brought Zen Buddhism to [[China]] in the [[5th century|fifth century]]. Later, [[Korea|Korean]] monks studying in [[China]] learned of Zen and spread it as far as [[Japan]] around the [[7th century|seventh century]]. Bodhidharma has also been linked to the spread of the East Asian martial arts traditions by popular history and mythology. However, little information supports this idea, and most students of martial history classify it as legend, not fact. Many of the martial systems that are identified with Zen practices tend to have more of a foundation in Taoist thought and design.

The Japanese Zen scholar [[D.T. Suzuki]] maintained that a Zen ''satori'' (understanding) was the goal of the training, but that what distinguished the Zen tradition as it developed in China, Korea, and Japan was a way of life radically different from that of Indian Buddhists. In India, the tradition of the [[mendicant]] (holy beggar) prevailed, but in China social circumstances led to the development of a temple and training-center system in which the abbot and the monks all performed mundane tasks. These included food gardening or farming, carpentry, architecture, housekeeping, administration, and the practice of folk medicine. Consequently, the enlightenment sought in Zen had to stand up well to the demands and potential frustrations of everyday life.

The following Zen traditions still exist in Japan: [[Rinzai]], [[Soto]], and [[Obaku School|Obaku]].  Originally formulated by the [[eponym]]ous Chinese master [[Linji]] (Rinzai in Japanese), the Rinzai school was introduced to [[Japan]] in [[1191]] by [[Eisai]]. [[Dogen]], who studied under Eisai, would later carry the [[Caodong]], or "Soto" Zen school to Japan from [[China]].  Obaku was introduced in the [[17th century]] by [[Ingen]], a Chinese monk.

==Zen teachings and practices==

Zen teachings often criticize [[text]]ual [[Hermeneutics|study]] and the pursuit of worldly accomplishments, concentrating primarily on meditation in pursuit of an unmediated awareness of the processes of the world and the mind. Zen, however, is no mere quietistic doctrine: the Chinese Zen master [[Baizhang]] ([[720]]-[[814]] CE), ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ''Hyakujo''), left behind a famous saying which had been the guiding principal of his life, "A day without work is a day of no eating." When Hyakujo was thought to be too old to work in the garden, his devotees hid his gardening tools. In response to this, the master then refused to eat, saying "No working, no living." 

These teachings are in turn deeply rooted in the Buddhist textual tradition, drawing primarily on [[Mahayana|Mah&#257;y&#257;na]] sutras composed in India and China, particularly the [[Heart Sutra]], the [[Diamond Sutra]], the [[Lankavatara Sutra]], and the ''Samantamukha Parivarta'', a chapter of the [[Lotus Sutra]]. The body of Zen doctrine also includes the recorded teachings of masters in the various Zen traditions.

===Zazen===

Zen meditation is called [[zazen]]. Zazen translates approximately to "[[sitting]] meditation", although it can be applied to practice in any posture. During zazen, practitioners usually assume a [[lotus position|lotus]], [[half-lotus]], burmese, or [[seiza]] [[sitting]] position. Rinzai practitioners typically sit facing the center of the room, while Soto practitioners sit facing a wall. Awareness is directed towards complete cognizance of one's posture and breathing. In this way, practitioners seek to transcend thought and be directly aware of the universe.

In Soto, [[shikantaza]] meditation, sometimes translated as "just-sitting," i.e., a meditation with no objects, anchors, "seeds," or content, is the primary form of practice. Considerable textual, philosophical, and phenomenological justification of this practice can be found in Dogen's [[Shobogenzo]].

===Koan practice===
The Zen schools (especially but not exclusively Rinzai) are associated with [[koan|koans]] (Japanese; Chinese: gongan; Korean: gong'an). The term originally referred to legal cases in [[Tang Dynasty|Tang-dynasty]] China. In some sense, a koan embodies a realized principle, or law of reality. Koans often appear paradoxical but are not meant to be apprehended rationally. Rather, Zen practitioners are said to recognize and actualize a koan in experience. An example of a Zen koan: "Two hands clap and there is a sound. What is the sound of one hand?". It is sometimes said that after diligent practice, the practitioner and the koan become one.

According to some interpretations, koans are by design absolute nonsense. This is in an effort to exhaust the intellect. Once the intellect is no longer relied upon, then enlightenment is more readily received or apprehended. However, other accounts hold that the problem posed by a koan is quite serious, and there there is a sharp distinction between right and wrong answers to it.

The principle in more detail, is that the only way one can stop the intellect from getting in the way of achieving enlightment is to force it to consider impossible scenarios (the koans) until it finally realizes the futility and gives up entirely. Once the intellect is out of the way, enlightenment is more readily attained. Though Rinzai aims for a "sudden" enlightenment, this usually only comes after a great deal of preparation.

The Zen student's mastery of a given koan is presented to the teacher (Roshi) in a private session called [[dokusan]]. The answer to a koan is more dependent on "how" it is answered rather than the correctness of the answer. Or, to put it somewhat differently, the answer is a function not merely of a reply, but of a whole modification of the student's experience; he or she must ''live'' the answer to the koan rather than merely offering a correct statement.

There is no single correct answer for any given koan, though there may be a set of correct and a set of incorrect answers, and indeed students in a cheating mindset would often compile books of accepted answers to Koans to help prepare for the interview; these collections are of great value to modern scholarship on the subject.

=="Zen" in Western pop-culture==

Many modern students have made the mistake of thinking that since much of Zen sounds like nonsense, especially in translation and out of context, any clever nonsense is also Zen. This is not the case, but see [[Discordianism]] and the [[Church of the SubGenius]] for modern semiserious religions influenced by this idea. The [[Expressionist]] and [[Dada]] movements and art tend to have much in common thematically with study of koans and actual Zen.

One might add that the modern Western pursuit of leisure and the acceptance of laziness have nothing in common with the industriousness of East Asian peoples, nor with the traditional tendency toward community self-reliance in the Zen tradition as it came out of China.

The novel [[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]] by the writer [[Robert M. Pirsig]] deals with the notion of 'quality' from the Zen-like point of view of the main character.

==Radical "Zen"==

Some Zen masters use very controversial methods of education. Vandalism of Zen values and beliefs is very common if used in good faith for the benefit of student. Lin Chi Zen Master said if you meet Buddha kill Buddha. If you meet Patriarch kill Patriarch. Zen Master Seung Sahn says that in this life we must all kill three things first we must kill parents. Second we must kill Buddha. And lastly, we must kill Seung Sahn.

Note: since zen and Buddhism respect life, literal killing is not meant.  What is meant is to kill slavish devotion to some one or some ideal that is held as a savior or salvation.  To see a savior is to see the concept outside of one's self, when the concept needs to be integrated or rather the pre-existing integration needs to be rediscovered ("[[original face]]").
