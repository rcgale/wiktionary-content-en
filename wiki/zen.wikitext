'''Zen''' is the [[Japanese]] name of a well known branch of [[Mahayana|Mah&#257;y&#257;na]] [[Buddhism]], practiced originally in [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], and [[Vietnam]].It stresses the role of [[meditation]] in pursuing [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]].  Besides this, it has been termed, by one Western commentator, "a way of life, work, and art."  Because Zen is the common name for this branch in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] as well as in [[English language|English]], this article will concern itself both with Zen as practiced in Japan and with Zen as an international phenomenon. For specific information on related practices in other countries, see the articles at the right.

==Spread of Zen==
Traditionally, Zen traces its roots back to [[Indian Buddhism]], where it was known by "[[dhyana|dhy&#257;na]]" (&#2343;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2344;), a [[Sanskrit]] term for meditation. This name was [[transliterate]]d into [[Chinese]] as ''[[Chan|Ch&aacute;n]]'' (&#31146;); "Ch&aacute;n" was later transliterated into [[Korean language|Korean]] as ''[[Seon]]'', [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] as ''[[Thien]]'' and then into Japanese as "Zen."

According to historical accounts, an [[Iran]]ian monk named [[Bodhidharma]] brought Dhyana Buddhism to [[China]] in the [[5th century|fifth century]]. Later, [[Korea|Korean]] monks studying in [[China]] learned what was by then called ''Chan'' and brought it to [[Japan]] around the [[7th century|seventh century]]. As a legendary [[culture hero]] Bodhidharma has also been linked to the [[Shaolin Temple]] and the subsequent spread of [[East Asian]] [[martial arts]] in the oral traditions of schools like [[Karate]] and [[T'ai Chi Ch'uan]], as well as in much popular [[wuxia]] fiction.  [[Image:BodhidharmaYoshitoshi1887.jpg|thumb|250px|'''Bodhidharma''', [[woodblock]] print by [[Yoshitoshi]], [[1887]].]]

The Japanese Zen scholar [[D.T. Suzuki]] maintained that a Zen ''satori'' (understanding) was the goal of the training, but that what distinguished the tradition as it developed in China, Korea, and Japan was a way of life radically different from that of Indian Buddhists. In India, the tradition of the [[mendicant]] (holy beggar) prevailed, but in China social circumstances led to the development of a temple and training-center system in which the abbot and the monks all performed mundane tasks. These included food gardening or farming, carpentry, architecture, housekeeping, administration, and the practice of folk medicine. Consequently, the enlightenment sought in Zen had to stand up well to the demands and potential frustrations of everyday life.

==Zen in Japan==
The following Zen traditions still exist in Japan: [[Rinzai]], [[Soto]], and [[Obaku School|Obaku]].  Originally formulated by the [[eponym]]ous Chinese master [[Linji]] (Rinzai in Japanese), the Rinzai school was introduced to [[Japan]] in [[1191]] by [[Eisai]]. [[Dogen]], who studied under Eisai, would later carry the [[Caodong]], or "Soto" Zen school to Japan from [[China]].  Obaku was introduced in the [[17th century]] by [[Ingen]], an Chinese monk.

==Zen teachings and practices==
Zen teachings often criticize [[text]]ual [[Hermeneutics|study]] and the pursuit of worldly accomplishments, concentrating primarily on meditation in pursuit of an unmediated awareness of the processes of the world and the mind. Zen, however, is no mere quietistic doctrine: the Chinese Chan master [[Baizhang]] ([[720]]-[[814]] CE), ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ''Hyakujo''), left behind a famous saying which had been the guiding principle of his life, "A day without work is a day of no eating." When Baizhan was thought to be too old to work in the garden, his devotees hid his gardening tools. In response to this, the master then refused to eat, saying "No working, no living." 

These teachings are in turn deeply rooted in the Buddhist textual tradition, drawing primarily on [[Mahayana|Mah&#257;y&#257;na]] sutras composed in India and China, particularly the [[Heart Sutra]], the [[Diamond Sutra]], the [[Lankavatara Sutra]], and the ''Samantamukha Parivarta'', a chapter of the [[Lotus Sutra]]. The body of Zen doctrine also includes the recorded teachings of masters in the various Zen traditions.

Zen is not primarily philosophy of an intellectual variety. In explaining the Zen Buddhist path to Westerners, Japanese Zen masters and authorities have frequently pointed out, moreover, that Zen is a ''way of life'' and not solely a state of consciousness. D.T. Suzuki thought the aspects of this way of life were: a life of humility; a life of labor; a life of service; a life of prayer and gratitude; and a life of meditation.

===Zazen===
Zen meditation is called [[zazen]]. Zazen translates approximately to "[[sitting]] meditation", although it can be applied to practice in any posture. During zazen, practitioners usually assume a [[lotus position|lotus]], [[half-lotus]], Burmese, or [[seiza]] sitting position. Rinzai practitioners typically sit facing the center of the room, while Soto practitioners sit facing a wall. Awareness is directed towards complete cognizance of one's posture and breathing. In this way, practitioners seek to transcend thought and be directly aware of the universe.

In Soto, [[shikantaza]] meditation, sometimes translated as "just-sitting," i.e., a meditation with no objects, anchors, "seeds," or content, is the primary form of practice. Considerable textual, philosophical, and phenomenological justification of this practice can be found in Dogen's [[Shobogenzo]].

===The teacher===
Because the Zen tradition emphasizes direct communication over scriptural study, the role of the Zen teacher is crucial. Generally speaking, a Zen teacher is a person ordained in any tradition of Zen to teach the dharma, guide students of meditation and perform rituals; in some cases, especially in modern Zen movements, a person not formally ordained may be able to fulfill some or all of these roles.  Honorific titles associated with teachers typically include, in Chinese: ''Fashi'' (&#27861;&#24107;) or ''Chanshi'' (&#31146;&#24107;); in Korean, ''Soen Sa''; in Japanese: ''[[Roshi]]'' or ''[[Sensei]]''; and in Vietnamese, ''[[Thich]]'' adopted in place of a surname. Note that many of these titles are common among Buddhist priests of all schools.

The term '''Zen master''' is often used to refer to important teachers, especially ancient and medieval ones.  However, there is no specific criterion by which one can be called a Zen master.  The term is less common in reference to modern teachers, because they are generally reluctant to proclaim themselves "masters."

===Koan practice===
The Zen schools (especially but not exclusively Rinzai) are associated 
with [[koan|koans]] (Japanese; Chinese: gongan; Korean: gong'an).  The 
term originally referred to legal cases in 
[[Tang Dynasty|Tang-dynasty]] China.  In some sense, a koan embodies a 
realized principle, or law of reality.  Koans often appear 
[[paradox]]ical, but this is because they are meant to be apprehended 
through [[metaphor]] and nonintuitive logic.  For this reason, they are 
often misconstrued as being absolute nonsense designed to exhaust the 
intellect.

Zen practitioners are said to recognize and actualize a koan in 
experience.  An example of a Zen koan is:  "Two hands clap and there is 
a sound.  What is the sound of one hand?"  It is sometimes said that 
after diligent practice, the practitioner and the koan become one.  
Though most Zen groups aim for a "sudden" enlightenment, this usually 
comes only after a great deal of preparation.

The problem posed by a koan is quite serious, and there is a sharp 
distinction between right and wrong ways of answering a koan &mdash; 
though there may be many "right answers", practitioners are expected 
to demonstrate their understanding of the koan and of Zen.

The Zen student's mastery of a given koan is presented to the teacher 
in a private session (called [[dokusan]] in Japanese).  The answer to a 
koan is more dependent on "how" it is answered rather than the 
correctness of the answer.  Or, to put it somewhat differently, the 
answer is a function not merely of a reply, but of a whole 
modification of the student's experience; he or she must ''live'' the 
answer to the koan rather than merely offering a correct statement.

There is no single correct answer for any given koan, though there may 
be a set of correct and a set of incorrect answers, and, indeed, 
students in a [[cheat]]ing mindset would often compile books of 
accepted answers to koans to help prepare for the interview.  These 
collections are of great value to modern scholarship on the subject.

==Zen and Western popular culture==
Since the [[1930s]] in the [[United Kingdom]], and at least since the 
[[1950s]] in the [[United States]], the West has had a growing interest 
in Zen.  The [[Expressionist]] and [[Dada]] movements in art tend to 
have much in common thematically with the study of koans and 
actual Zen.

''[[The Dharma Bums]]'', a [[novel]] written by [[Jack Kerouac]] and 
published in [[1959]], gave its readers a look at how a fascination 
with Buddhism and Zen was being absorbed into lifestyle 
experimentation by a small group of mainly west-coast American 
youths.  Besides the narrator, the main character in this novel was 
[[Gary Snyder]], thinly veiled as "Japhy Ryder" by his friend 
Kerouac.  The story was based on actual events that occurred when 
Snyder pursued formal Zen studies in Japanese monasteries between 
[[1956]] and [[1968]].

Many youths in the [[Beat generation]] and among the [[hippies]] of the 
[[1960s]] and [[1970s]] misunderstood the goals and methods of Zen.  
While the scholar [[D.T. Suzuki]] may have brought attention to 
concepts in Zen such as humility, labor, service, prayer, gratitude, 
and meditation, the "hip" subculture often focused on states of 
[[consciousness]] in themselves.  Japanese Zen master 
[[Zenkei Shibayama]] commented:  "It may be true that the effect which 
such scientifically prepared [[hallucinogen|drug]]s [as LSD] produce 
may have some superficial resemblance to some aspects of Zen 
experience....  When the effect of the drug is gone, the psychological 
experience one may have had is also weakened and dispersed, and does 
not endure as a living fact."

The British-American [[philosopher]] [[Alan Watts]] had a personal 
interest in the Zen school of Buddhism and wrote and lectured 
extensively on it.  He was interested in it as a vehicle for a mystical 
transformation of consciousness, and also in the historical example of 
a non-Western, non-[[Christianity|Christian]] way of life that had 
fostered both the practical and [[fine arts]].

The book ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]'', by 
[[Robert M. Pirsig]], deals with the notion of "quality" from the 
point of view of the main character.  The book is largely based on the 
author's experience with [[archery]] instruction; Zen practitioners 
consider Pirsig to misunderstand and misrepresent the foundations 
of Zen.

Many modern students have made the mistake of thinking that since much 
of Zen sounds like nonsense, especially in [[translation]] and out of 
[[context]], any clever nonsense is also Zen.  This is not the case 
&mdash; see ''[[koan]]'' &mdash; but the [[Church of the SubGenius]] 
and especially [[Discordianism]] have been influenced by this idea.

==Kill Zen==
Some Zen masters use very controversial methods of education.  Unorthodox expressions of Zen values and beliefs are very common.

A [[Linji]] Zen Master said "If you meet the Buddha, kill the Buddha. If you meet a Patriarch, kill the Patriarch."  Zen Master [[Seung Sahn]] says that in this life we must all kill three things: first we must kill parents; second we must kill Buddha; and last, we must kill Seung Sahn.  (Zen and Buddhism deeply respect life and teach non-violence; ''kill'' here is not literally killing.  What is meant is to kill one's devotion to teachers or other external objects.  Rather than see concepts outside of themselves, the practitioners must integrate these objects with their concepts of ''self''.)
