'''Zen''' (&#31109; in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], ''ch'an'' in [[Mandarin]], &#31146;) [[Buddhism]] is a fusion of [[Mahayana Buddhism|Mahayana Buddhist]] beliefs with [[Taoism]]. Zen especially emphasizes the practice of [[meditation]]. It developed when teachers from [[India]], the original homeland of [[Buddhism]], founded schools in [[China]], where it was known as ch'an. Ch'an is the [[Mandarin]] transliteration of the [[Sanskrit]] word channa or [[dhyana]]. The canonical exemplar of these teachers is [[Bodhidharma]], the Indian monk who traditionally founded Zen Buddhism at the [[Shaolin]] Temple in the fifth century CE. Later, [[Japan|Japanese]] monks studying in [[China]] learned of Zen and brought it back to Japan, where several divergent schools of thought emerged.

Influenced by Taoism, Zen de-emphasizes study and worldly deeds, and concentrates instead on meditation and a non-rational awareness of the world and the way the mind reacts to it.

Zen tradition holds that the highest form of spiritual practice is ''[[zazen]]'' meditation. Zazen translates approximately to ''just sitting''. During zazen, practitioners assume the [[lotus position]] and sit facing a wall. Awareness is directed towards complete cognizance of one's posture and breathing. In this way, practictioners seek to transcend thought and be directly aware of the universe.

Later schools (especially [[Rinzai]]) developed the famous [[koan|koans]], paradoxical "riddles" or "puzzles" designed to shock the mind out of its rationalistic rut and into a non-discriminatory awareness.

The following Zen traditions still exist in Japan: [[Soto]] Zen, [[Rinzai]] Zen and [[Obaku]]. Founder of the Soto Zen school was the famous Zen master [[Dogen|Dogen Zenji]] ([[1200]]-[[1253]]). Lin-Chi (Rinzai in Japanese) founded Rinzai Zen and Obaku founded the Obaku school. 

Many modern students have made the mistake of thinking that since much of Zen sounds like nonsense, then any clever nonsense is also Zen. This is not the case, but see [[Discordianism]] and the [[Church of the SubGenius]] for modern semiserious religions influenced by this idea.
