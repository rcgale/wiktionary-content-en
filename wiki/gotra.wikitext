Gotras are further divison of the Caste for Hindus in India.
Gotra means "Cow-pen". over the years it has become a ritualisrtic parameter for the ancestory. presumably, people who went to a particular Sage for the vedic studies came to acquire the Gotra named after that Sage. The said is true for the Brahminical Gotras only. for Non-Brahminical Gotras, their origin is attributed to many things, the concept of Gram-Devta being the most common one.
