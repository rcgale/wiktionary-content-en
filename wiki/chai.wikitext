===Pronounciation===
ch-I 
*SAMPA: /tSaI/
===Etymology===
Chai is borrowed from Hindi and other Indian languages. It originated from the Cantonese (dialect of Chinese) pronounciation of the character[[èŒ¶]] [[Image:Tea.bmp]], which means "tea". The Minnan dialect's pronounciation is the root of the word "[[tea]]" in many other languages (including English).

===Noun===
In English speaking countries, generally used to refer to a beverage made with black teas, steamed milk and sweet spices based loosely on Indian recipes. This term has been used with the recent adoption of 'chai lattes' in coffee houses.

Chai can also refer to teas in general or specific brands depending on how they are marketed. This is because chai itself in Indian languages as well as Arabic, Persian and others just refers to tea. However, general or more constrained usages are obscure.
