{{Move to Wiktionary}}

A saying meaning someone that tries to be competent in all endevors, but excells at none of them. One such example is the [[Charlatan]] in Age of Wonders. Also, wikipedia itself could be concidered a "Jack of all trades, master of none" since it has information on all subjects, but doesn't have exceptional information on any.
