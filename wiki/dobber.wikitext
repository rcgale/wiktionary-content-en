##(''collq./tech.'') Small electronic device that plugs directly into a larger electronic device. E.g:  Wireless scoring systems (fencing), USB mass storage devices, etc.

''Etymology:'' The word originally referred only to ''Electronic Coaching aids''; small scoring devices that are plugged directly into the fencing foil or epee and used for basic scoring instead of the larger scoring machines.  However, its use has since spread into more general areas of technical vocabulary, becoming particularly prominent in the BBC Radio Online and IT departments.
