A Brahmin (less often Brahman) is a member of the Hindu priestly caste. The word is related to but not to be confused with Hindu religious conception of the transcendent and immanent super soul, "Brahman".

Brahminism is a term commonly used to denote a system of religious institutions originated and elaborated by the Brahmins, the sacerdotal and, from an early period, the dominant caste of the Hindu community.

The word Brahmin literally means One who has realized or attempts to realize Brahman.
