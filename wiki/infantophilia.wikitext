'''Infantophilia''' which is also called '''nepiophilia''' or ''infantilism'' is the sexual attraction to small children (0-5 years old). Some researchers believe infantophilia should be distinguished from [[pedophilia]].

The infantilism described in this article should not be confused with the [[paraphilia]] consisting in dressing like a baby (See [[Infantilism]]).
