A '''flexitarian''' (also '''vegevenient''') is a flexible [[vegetarian]] or [[vegan]].  For instance, a flexitarian might make only vegetarian dishes at home, but eat dishes including [[meat]] at the home of family or friends.

Ethically, flexitarians tend not to lean towards vegetarianism because of [[animal rights]], as there would be a stringent moral rule involved. Instead, flexitarians are generally vegan or vegetarian for the ethical reason that vegetarian food conserves water and land resources, and feeds more people. Some believe that wasting already-cooked food does more damage than eating it.
