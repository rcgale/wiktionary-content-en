'''Flexitarianism''' is the practice of being flexible about the degree one practices [[vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]].  A flexitarian might make only vegetarian dishes at home, but eat dishes including [[meat]] at the home of family or friends.

Ethically, flexitarians tend not to lean towards vegetarianism due to [[animal rights]] concerns, as there would be a stringent moral rule involved. Some reasons people choose to follow flexitarianism are as follows:

* They believe vegetarian food conserves water and land resources.
* They believe vegetarian food feeds more people.
* Some, like [[freegan]]s, believe that wasting already-cooked food does more damage than eating it.
* They are not ethically opposed to eating meat, but find a vegetarian diet to be less expensive.
* Other members of their household are vegetarian and flexitarian diet is more convenient.
* They consider a vegetarian diet to be healthier, but enjoy eating meat.
