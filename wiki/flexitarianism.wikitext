A '''flexitarian''' is a person who is flexible about the degree he or she practices [[vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]].  For instance, a flexitarian might make only vegetarian dishes at home, but eat dishes including [[meat]] at the home of family or friends.

Ethically, flexitarians tend not to lean towards vegetarianism due to [[animal rights]] concerns, as there would be a stringent moral rule involved. Instead, flexitarians are generally vegan or vegetarian for the ethical reason that vegetarian food conserves water and land resources, and feeds more people. Some, like [[freegan]]s, believe that wasting already-cooked food does more damage than eating it.
