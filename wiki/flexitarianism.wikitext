Also known as: vegevenient (vegetarian when it is convenient)

A flexitarian is flexible about being vegetarian.  For instance, all home cooking might be vegetarian (because it is significantly healthier and easier to clean), but many friends and family members serve food including meat.  For some flexitarians, meat still occasionally tastes good, especailly at family gatherings and at office receptions.  An additional common reason why someone may be a flexitarian is: someone has already cooked the food,  and wasting the food seems a worse idea than eating it.  

Ethically, flexitarians tend not to lean towards vegetarianism because of animal rights (or else there would be a stringent moral rule involved); instead, flexitarians are generally vegan or vegetarian for the ethical reason that eating vegetarian conserves water and land resources, and feeds more people.  Meat uses significantly more water and land than any possible vegetable source of food; however, in small occasional amounts meat is not objectionable.
