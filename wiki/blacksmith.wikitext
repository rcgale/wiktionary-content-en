=== Etymology ===

[[black]] for color of iron + [[smith]] related to [[smite]]

=== Noun ===

# A person who [[forge]]s iron.
# (''colloquial'') A person who shoes horses (properly a [[ferrier]]).

=== Usage note ===

Historically, blacksmiths in small communities have played a number of other roles, including [[ferrier]], [[wainwright]] and [[wheelwright]].  However, blacksmithing properly refers to the forging of iron, and blacksmiths and ferriers themselves make the distinction.
