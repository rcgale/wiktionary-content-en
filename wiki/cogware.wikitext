#:'''Quotations'''
#:*'''1964''': The better quality was used for ordinary cloths, and the worst was made up into coarse cloth known as cogware and Kendal cloth, three quarters of a yard broad, and worth from 40d. to 5s. the piece.  The term cogware seems to have sprung from its being sold to cogmen, the crews of the ships called [[cog]]s; but whether for their own use, or for export is not quite clear. &mdash; L.F. Salzman, ''English Industries of the Middle Ages'', p. 207.
#a coarse, [[narrow]] cloth, like [[frieze]], used by the lower classes in the sixteenth century.
