'''The gooseneck''' is the swivel connection on a [[sailboat]] located near the bottom of the [[mast]] that the [[boom]] attaches to. When a sailboat performs a [[tack]] or a [[jibe]] the gooseneck swings the boom from one side of the boat to the other.

A species of [[barnacle]] is sometimes called the [[Gooseneck Barnacle]], or the [[Goose barnacle]], due to its resemblance to the head and neck of a goose.
