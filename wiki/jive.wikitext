==English==

===Verb===
# (''US, colloquial'') To be deceptive.
#: ''Don't try to jive me!  I know where you were last night!''
# (''US, colloquial'') To agree or accord.
#: ''That explanation at least jives with what we know.''

====Usage Note====

The use of ''jive'' for "to agree or accord" stems from confusion with the less widely-known [[jibe]].  Strictly speaking, ''jibe'' is correct, but ''jive'' is seen regularly, even in national publications.

===Noun===
'''jive'''

# (''US, colloquial'') Nonsense; transparently deceptive talk.
#: ''Don't give me that jive.  I know where you were last night.''
