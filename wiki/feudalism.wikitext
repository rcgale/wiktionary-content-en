===Noun===
'''feudalism'''  ''(uncountable)''

#A social system based on personal ownership of resources and personal [[fealty]] between a [[suzerain]] (lord) and a [[vassal]] (subject). Some social-evolutionary theories hold that mankind is evolving through several stages which started with [[communism]] and will ultimately return there, have passed through classical society, feudalism, and [[capitalism]], although these phases seem more characteristic just of Europe than elsewhere. Defining characteristics are direct ownership of resources, personal loyalty, and a [[heirarchical]] social structure reinforced by religion.
