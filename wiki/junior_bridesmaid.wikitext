A junior bridesmaid is a bridesmaid that is too young to be a full bridesmaid, but too old to be a flower girl. Usually the junior bridesmaid walks down the aisle unaccompanied by a groomsman, but can be accompanied if the wedding party has an uneven number of people. 

Otherwise, the junior bridesmaid's responsibilites are much the same as that of a regular bridesmaid.
