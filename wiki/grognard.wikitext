'''Grognard''' (Fr. "grumbler") may mean:

* [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s name for old veteran soldiers.
* ''slang'' for someone who enjoys playing [[wargaming#Board wargaming|board wargames]]. This use is supposed to have been coined by John Young in the early 1970s while employed by [[Simulations Publications, Inc.]]. Originally this term refered to the "old guard" of gamers who were playing tactical board games prior to 1969.
* Inside the computer game development industry, the term '''grognard''' is used to name fans who will buy every game released in a certain genre of game ([[Real-time_strategy|RTS]], [[Computer_role-playing_game|RPG]], etc...). These dedicated game players are often viewed as a blessing and a curse, as they will ensure a certain minimum level in sales, but they will also be the most critical of any mistakes or [[Computer_bug|bugs]] in the game.
