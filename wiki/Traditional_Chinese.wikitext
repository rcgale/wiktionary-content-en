'''[[Traditional]] [[Chinese]]'''
===Noun===
# Traditional Chinese characters ([[繁體]]) are used in Republic of China (Taiwan),
replaced in People's Republic of China by [[Simplified Chinese]]([[簡體]]) .

In countries which borrowed Chinese writing (Japan, Korea etc.), characters resemble Traditional Chinese more than [[Simplified Chinese]]. Although, in Japan, kanji were simplified by another way (shinjitai, [[新字体]]).
