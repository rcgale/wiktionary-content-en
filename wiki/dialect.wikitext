A dialect is a variety of languages. 

Linguistics point of view. People of different dialects but the same language can understand each other while people of different languages cannot.

However, political issues matters : some states claims to have different languages, while on the linguistics point of view it is not.

Conclusion

In the language of the average man,  a dialect is a mix of the two points of view. There also difficulties to determine to what extent you may say that ''people are understanding each other''
