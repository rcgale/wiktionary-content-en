#:'''Quotations'''
#:*'''1786''': The brigandine takes its name from the [[troop]]s, by which it was first worn, who were called [[brigan]]s, they were a kind of light armed [[irregular]] [[foot]], much [[addicted]] to [[plunder]], whence it is probable the [[appellation]] of [[brigand]]s was given to other [[freebooter]]s. &mdash; Francis Grose, ''A Treatise on Ancient Armour and Weapons'', page 19.
