===Etymology===
Possibly derived from the Old French term 'paneterie'.
===Noun===
'''pantry'''
#A small [[room]], [[closet]], or [[cabinet]] usually located in or near the [[kitchen]], dedicated to food storage.  Since the pantry is not typically temperature-controlled (unlike a refrigerator or [[root cellar]]), the foods stored in a pantry are usually [[shelf-stable]] [[staple]]s such as grains, flours, and preserved foods.
