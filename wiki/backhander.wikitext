The '''backhander''' can be one of two completely different things.

The first is a bribe commonly given by a contractor to an official in charge of a project in order to assure the choice of the contractor in a supposedly competitive bidding situation.

The second is a disciplinary action commonly practiced by authority figures in which a swift blow is issued with the back side of one's hand to the face of an unsuspecting miscreant. The element of surprise is key in the delivery of a good backhander as the shock of the unexpected blow is often more painful than the blow itself. The backhander is not to be confused with the [[backstroke]].
