A derogatory term used in online games for a player who stays in a tactically useless area and does not move. Often, players who choose to stay in advantageous areas are called this as well. Spawncamper refers to someone who, in order improve his or her killcount, either enter a spawning zone or aim a sniper rifle or other scope-mounted weapon at one in order to kill other players immediatly or soon after they respawn. This is considered one of the most highly offensive things one can do on the internet.
