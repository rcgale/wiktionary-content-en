An '''ecolect''' is a [[language]] [[dialect]] unique to a household (from the Greek ''eco (oikos)'' for house, as in [[economy]] or [[ecology]], and ''lect'' for language).  An ecolect probably evolves from an [[idiolect]], which is individual specific, when other household members adopt that individual's unique words and phrases, that are not in use in surrounding households or the wider community.  (The word ''ecolect'' is a [[neologism]].)
