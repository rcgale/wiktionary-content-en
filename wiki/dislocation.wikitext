'''dislocation'''

#The act of [[displacing]], or the state of being [[displaced]].
#The displacement of parts of [[rocks]] or portions of [[strata]] from the situation which they originally occupied. [[Slips]], [[faults]], and the like, are dislocations.
#The act of dislocating, or putting out of [[joint]]; also, the condition of being thus [[displaced]].
#(''materials'') A [[linear]] [[defect]] in a [[crystal]] [[lattice]].  Because dislocations can shift within the crystal lattice, they tend to weaken the material, compared to a perfect crystal.
