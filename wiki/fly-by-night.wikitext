The phrase '''fly by night''' is a derisive term for [[business]]es that appear and disappear rapidly, or that give an impression of transience. It has also been applied to individual traveling businessmen and tradesmen. The phrase implies that the quality of work done or goods sold is shoddy enough that the person responsible must leave town under cover of darkness to evade angry [[customer]]s, or sometimes [[law|legal]] authorities.

A classic portrayal of a traveling salesman as a fly-by-night operator is the [[Broadway]] [[musical theater|musical]] and [[film]], ''[[The Music Man]]''.
