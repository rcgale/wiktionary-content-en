#: ''Aah! That's amazing!''
# indication of [[joy]]ful [[pleasure]]
# indication of sympathy

====Usage====
Usually the verb is intransitive. The object of feelings usually is indicated by the prepositions [[over]] or [[at]]; sometimes it occurs as a direct object, especially in passive constructions. 

Very often the word is used together with some other verb derived from an interjection. The most common combination is ''to [[ooh]] and aah''. Perhaps it should be regarded as a separate lexical item.  

The word belongs to the informal style.
