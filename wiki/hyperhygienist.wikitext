'''Hyperhygienist''' is a [[pejorative]] adjective applied to certain [[agricultural policy|agricultural policies]], [[law]]s, [[food regulation]]s, [[wholesale food]] buying rules, and [[tax, tariff and trade]] measures by advocates of [[organic farming]].  It refers to an over-emphasis on a narrow definition of "safety" or "cleanliness" as defined only for the [[consumer]], that effectively forces the use of [[pesticide]]s, other chemicals, or even requires or encourages [[genetically modified organism]]s (since natural varieties often cannot stand up to the chemical load required to prevent all insect).

Those who use this adjective consider over-regulation to be as much or more of a problem than under-regulation of foodstuffs.  They point to the long term [[deterioration of the environment]] caused by the artificial means which are the only way to meet the standards, or which drive [[family farm]]s out of business in favor of larger scale [[agribusiness]].

The [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] recently passed stringent standards for [[seafood]] and other food imports to the US, nominally to prevent tampering by [[terrorism|terrorists]].  Critics have accused these regulations as being hyperhygienist, doing too much to prevent deliberate threats to [[biosecurity]], and not enough to prevent the many natural threats arising from the crossing of [[ecoregion|ecological borders]] by foodstuffs.  Defenders within the organic food movement sometimes respond that regulations that increase the expense of imported food always work to the benefit of more local food - thus expensive storage and transport systems or punitive tariffs levied to pay for them will ultimately drive the entire [[export food]] industry out of business worldwide, and create niches for local organic agriculture that could not compete directly without it.
