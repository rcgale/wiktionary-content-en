'''Winkte''' is an old [[Lakota]] word, "Winyanktehca," that has been contracted through long use. Its meaning is 'two-souls-person,' or more directly, 'to be as a woman' and applies to males, the female term being Koskalaka (Gunn Allen, 1989).  It generally refers to someone who is [[transgender]] (i.e., male humans who do not conform to the ordinary man's gender role). The winkte are not despised. To the contrary they are considered to be people with special spiritual and other talents that fulfill some needs of the community that other people could not fill.

NB: Some people are spelling the word 'winkte' others 'wintke'
