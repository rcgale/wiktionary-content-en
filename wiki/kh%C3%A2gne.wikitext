Kh�gne is an informal term used by French students for Classes Pr�paratoires Litt�raires, the two year cycle of classes taken after the Baccalaureat [approximately at age 17-18] to prepare for the difficult entrance examination to the Ecole Normale Superieure.  Only the better and more ambitious students take kh�gne.
