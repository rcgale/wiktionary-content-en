==English==

==={{Abbreviation}}===
'''ft.'''
# [[fort]]
#:''Ft. Lauderdale''
# [[foot]]

====Usage note {{UK}}====
As this abbreviation only eliminates the use of one character, the full word, [[Fort]], is generally preferred.  It is also never appropriate to use this abbreviation in body text in any form.  The same applies to [[Mt.|Mt]] for [[Mount]], [[So.]] for [[South]], and [[No.]] for [[North]].  Use Ft is only appropriate when space necessitates.

====Usage note {{US}}====
As different regions have different punctuation schemes, this term can be considered contentious (but only by Brits) when used to mean "foot" as is often done in America.
