==English==
===Abbreviation===
'''ft.'''

#[[fort]]
#:''Ft. Lauderdale''

====Usage Note====
As this abbreviation only eliminates the use of one character, the full word, [[Fort]], is generally preferred.  It is also never appropriate to use this abbreviation in body text in any form.  The same applies to [[Mt.]] for [[Mount]], [[So.]] for [[South]], and [[No.]] for [[North]].  Use Ft. is only appropriate when space necessitates.
