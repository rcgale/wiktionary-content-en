Variant (esp. southern American) of the word "haunt," usually used in noun form. I.e., "Joe-Bob and Nelly swore up and down that the thing that pushed their pick-up into the ditch wasn't a big brown bear, but a spectral ha'nt, most likely Joe-Bob's deceased ex-wife."

Pronounced so that it rhymes with 'ant' or 'pant'.
