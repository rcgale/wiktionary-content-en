Germany's "Autobahnen" were concieved as a defense highway system by the German general staff during the 1930s in anticipation of world war two.
It was started soon after 1933. It was only partially completed before september 1939. After the war it was greatly extpanded and they are still working on it.
It impressed the U S military while it invaded Germany. ultimately the
U S congress passed the 'Defense and Interstate Highway Bill'.
