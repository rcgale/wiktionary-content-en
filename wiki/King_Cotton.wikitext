'''King Cotton''' is a [[phrase]] used in the [[Southern United States]] before the [[American Civil War]].  The phrase was used mainly by Southern [[politician|polititcians]] and authors who wanted to illustrate the importance of the [[crop]] to southern economy. This is because Southern [[Plantation|Plantations]] generated three-fourths of the world's [[cotton]] supply.[http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/gahff/html/ff_108100_kingcotton.htm]  In particular, after the invention of the [[cotton gin]] the production of cotton surpassed that of [[tabacco]] in the south and became the dominate [[cash crop]].  Eventually over half of the [[United States]] exports were cotton.
