=== Etymology ===
The word ''vertebra'' comes from Latin ''[[vertere]]'' which means "to turn". Having multiple ''vertebrae'' (plural of ''vertebra'') in one's backbone instead of having a single bone or solid spine, allows for the movement of the body with bends and turns.

== [[noun]] ==
#small bone which make up the [[backbone]].
