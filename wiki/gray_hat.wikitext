In the [[computer security]] community, a "Gray hat" is a skilled [[hacker]] who sometimes acts legally and in good will and sometimes not.  They are a hybrid between white and black hat hackers.  They hack for no personal gain, and do not have malicious intentions, but commit crimes.
For example, attacking corporate businesses with unethical practices could be regarded as highly ethical and yet would normally be tagged with the title of Blackhat activity. However, to a Gray hat, it may not appear bad even though it is against that local law. So instead of tagging it Black hat, it is a Gray hat hack.
