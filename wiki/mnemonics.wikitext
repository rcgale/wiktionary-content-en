A '''mnemonic''' ([[SAMPA]] /n@mAnIc/ in US or /ni:mQnIc/ in UK) is a [[memory]] aid.  Mnemonics are often verbal, are sometimes in verse form, and are often used to remember lists.  Mnemonics rely not only on repetition to remember facts, but also on creating associations among easy-to-remember constructs and lists of data. The word ''mnemonic'' shares etymology with ''[[Mnemosyne]]'', the name of the [[Titan (mythology)|titan]] who personified Memory in [[Greek mythology]]. [WIKIPEDIA]
