'''Database Publishing''' is mostly used as a term for the data based, automated media production, the make up of pricelists and catalouges.

The basic idea is to hand over database content, like artiklenumbers and priceinformation, to designed layout documents and in case of changes to update actual priceinformations, without additionals detours.

The major layout applications for this kind of usage are: [http://www.adobe.com Adobe] FrameMaker / InDesign and [http://www.quark.com Quark]XPress. Other variations of Database Publishing are "rendering" contents direct to printable PDF-Output.

The actual layout applications offers the possibility using XML and a scripting to customized the setting of tasks. The main scriptlanguages are  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Script Apple Script], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Script Java Script] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic Visual Basic].

Most of the layout applications can be entlargded with third party solutions for connecting databases and use their contents.For Adobe InDesign they are called plug-ins and for Quark XPress we talking about xtensions.
