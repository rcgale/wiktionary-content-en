"'''Fashion police'''" is an imaginary [[police]] force, making sure that people dress according to [[fashion]]. The term is jokingly used for self-appointed individuals who [[critic]]ise or critique the [[clothing]] others wear, and thereby those others' fashion sense.  The term can sometimes be used in a disparaging sense, holding that the '''fashion police''' have a narrow, rigid or uncreative sense of style or propriety, or it can be used with approval of what the presumed judgment of the '''fashion police''' would be if present ("Somebody call the fashion police!"), if the speaker believes someone has committed a fashion <i>[[faux pas]]</i>.
