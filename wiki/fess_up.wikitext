*''' 'fess up'''  ''(with preceding apostrophy)''

===Intransitive phrasal verb===
'''fess up''' ('''[[fesses up]]''', '''[[fessing up]]''', '''[[fessed up]]''')

# {{slang}} (''frequently used in the [[imperative]]'') To [[confess]] to something; to [[admit]] something.  
#:'''example''': " 'Fess up, Ju-ju"  (from the novel ''Seven Little Australians'')
#:'''variant example''': "There's something I want to up and fess, Marmee." (from the American novel ''Little Women'')

====Usage note====
In the US, this can be heard more often in Southern dialects.

It is generally used by children, or by adults adressing children, and therefore has childish connotations, at least in Australian English.  It is somewhat dated.
