The aesculapian staff is the symbol used by the Veterinary profession much the same as the caduceus is used by the medical profession. It differs from the caduceus in that the staff has only one twined snake instead of two. The aesculapian staff is named for Aesculapias, the Roman god of medicine and healing.
