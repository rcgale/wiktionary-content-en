====Translations====
(''See also the translation notes below'')

*English: [[one]], [[you]], [[we]], [[they]], [[people]] (1); [[he]], [[she]], [[it]] (2); [[each other]], [[one another]] (3); [[himself]], [[herself]], [[itself]] (4a); [[oneself]] (4b); [[themselves]] (5)

=====Translation notes=====
*''Si'' is often translated using the passive in English.  Example: ''"Casa" si scrive C, A, S, A.'' ("Casa" is spelled C, A, S, A.)
*When ''si'' is attached to end of the infinitive (which is more usual than placing it as a separate word before the infinitive), the final -e is dropped, or, in the case of infinitives ending in -rre, the final -re is dropped.  Examples: ''amare'' + ''si'' = ''amarsi''; ''ridurre'' + ''si'' = ''ridursi''.  (Is the -rre rule correct?  Needs to be checked by a native speaker.)
