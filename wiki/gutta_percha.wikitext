A resin derived from the Isonandra Gutta tree in Malaya. Gutta-percha was produced by evaporating the milky fluid extracted from the tree and coagulating the latex. It was used as an inelastic insulator that was hard but not brittle. It proved to be a superior insulator and was used in transatlantic cables replacing the previously used India rubber.
