===Etymology===
[[bi-]] + [[week]] + [[-ly]]

=== Adjective ===
'''biweekly'''
# occuring once every two [[week]]s
# ''(see usage note, etymologically incorrect):'' occuring twice a week

===Adverb===
'''biweekly'''
# every two weeks
# ''(see usage note, etymologically incorrect):'' twice a week

==== See also ====
*[[semiweekly]]
*[[fortnightly]] ''(UK)''

====Usage note====
The prefix '''[[bi-]]''' applies to the ''week'', not to activites around a week.  Miss-using the term to mean an activity performed twice in one week is etymologically incorrect and certain to cause confusion.  Because of the confusion of the ''twice-in-one-week'' meaning, the second meaning should be avoided.  Also for this reason, the term [[semiweekly]] could conceivably be listed here as both a synonym and an antonym.

Additionally, the term seems to be more ambiguous in the UK than the US; in the US there exists only the rare terms ''biweekly'' and ''semiweekly''; in the UK there seems to be a wide variety of terms that perhaps add to the confusion.

=== Noun ===
'''biweekly''' ''pl.'' '''biweeklies'''
# that which is published or released once every two weeks
#: ''The local paper is a [[biweekly]].''
