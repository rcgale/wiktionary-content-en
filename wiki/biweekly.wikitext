===Usage notes===
*In the adjective and adverb senses, the prefix '''[[bi-]]''' applies to the week rather than to the events that occur, therefore giving the sense of "every two weeks".  Since the term is also used in the UK to mean "twice a week", it is ambiguous there.  For the sake of clarity, it is advisable to use one of the synonyms instead.
