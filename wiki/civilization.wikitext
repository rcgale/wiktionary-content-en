Hardly adequate !!

Common usage would suggest two associated but variant meanings;

1. A stage or system of social, political or technical development of a large scale order encompassing several or many [[community|communities]], often on the [[nation]] or [[people]] scale. <i>(ancient civilisations; western civilisation; the Aztec civilisation.) cf [[culture]]</i>.

2. Those people of the world considered to have a high standard of behavior, implying a high level of development. Commonly subjectively used by people of one civilisation to exclusively refer to their civilisation, or their sub-group, or a few associated civilisations, implying all others, in time or geography or status, as something less than [[civilise|civilised]], as [[savage|savages]] or [[barbarian|barbarians]]. <i>cf [[refinement]], [[elitism]], [[civilised society]]</i>

3. The act of becoming or making civilised.
