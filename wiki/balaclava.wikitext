==noun==

:The name ''"balaclava"'' comes from Balaklava in the Crimea. During the Crimean War, knitted ''balaclavas'' were sent over to the British troops to help protect them from the bitter cold weather.

A ''' ''Balaclava'' ''' is a type of headgear usually worn as a ski mask (It should not be confused with [[Baklava]], which is a type of dessert).

A ''balaclava'', (also known as a balaclava helmet or ski mask) is a form of headgear covering the whole head, often exposing only the eyes and mouth. 

''Balaclavas'' are traditionally knitted from wool, and can be rolled up into a hat to cover just the crown of the head. Modern balaclavas can be made from several different textile materials.

''Balaclavas'' are often associated with covert operations and special forces units such as the SAS, or terrorist organizations like the IRA or with muggers where they act as a form of disguise.
