from Greek <!--Greek-->''gnw`mon'' one that knows, a guardian, ''i.e.'',
of the treasures in the inner parts of the earth, or from &?;
intelligence, both from <!--Greek-->''gnw^nai'', <!--Greek-->''gignw^skein'', to

<!-- The Greek words should probably be changed to Greek letters; the current transliterations are directly from PG. -->
<!-- I have no idea what the &?; stuff is; that's also directly from PG. -->
