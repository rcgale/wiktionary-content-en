'''Outdusis''' is a [[Penawapskewi]] or [[Penobscot]] [[Indian]] word, and it means "little [[pathway]]." The [http://www.penobscotnation.org Penobscot Nation] is a sovereign Indian tribe, located on an island within the [[Penobscot River]], in [[Penobscot County]], [[Maine]]. The root of the word, "out-du," means "trail," or "pathway." The suffix, "sis," indicates the diminutive form of the [[root]] it modifies.

That being said, there is a belief system in place that this word is used to describe; analogous to what the [[France|French]] interpret as "[[debrouillage]]."  Simply put, "find your own way."  Supposedly, this path leads to personal enlightenment and fulfillment.

However, outdusis describes the individual in terms of their personal values and integrity: how one behaves when no one else is around.
