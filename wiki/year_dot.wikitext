'''Year dot''' is an old-fashioned expression meaning a very long time ago. 

"Since the year dot" can mean "from the beginning".  The phrase may originate from a representation of the zeroth or first year, or the point between [[1|AD 1]] and [[1 BC]] as there is no [[0 (year)|Year 0]]. As in "That hat dates from the year dot."
