A measure of the wealth of a nation, calculated in any of three ways. The output method is the total of selling prices less the cost of bought-in materials. The income method is the total of wages, rents, dividends, interest, and profits. The expenditure method is the national expenditure on goods and services (known as ‘GDP at factor cost’). The last method is the one most used by economists in forecasting economic growth. The gross national product (GNP) is similarly calculated, but includes residents’ income from economic activity overseas.
