#:'''Quotations'''
#:*'''1952''': Oil was also used for making varnish, by dissolving sandarac in it, and as the 'vernysshe' which appears so frequently in accounts was always bought by the pound, the term was evidently applied to the sandarac, or other similar resinous substance. &mdash; L.F. Salzman, ''Building in England'', p. 171.
