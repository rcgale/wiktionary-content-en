'''Interim''' is a term meaning "in between", "transitional", or "temporary."

Some common "interim" items:

* An '''interim report'''- commonly a report on the status of a project or other assignment that is not yet completed
* An '''interim document'''- a transitional draft of a document that is still in the process of being agreed upon. Examples could include an interim business agreement, an interim [[ceasefire]], or an interim [[constitution]]. 
* An '''interim official'''- a person who is temporarily exercising the powers of an office. This usually occurs during periods between the terms of two office holders, or during a brief period in which the office holder is temporarily unable to exercise his authority. For example, a school may have an interim [[principal]], or a nation may have an interim [[prime minister]]. See also [[acting]] and [[ad interim]]. Interim officials often are hired with the express understanding that they will occupy the position until a complete candidate search can be completed: this is often the case where an organization needs ''someone'' to lead it during the potentially lengthy process of finding a permanent replacement.
