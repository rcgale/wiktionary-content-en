'''Synonyms:''' -- To [[subside]]; [[decrease]]; [[intermit]]; [[decline]]; [[diminish]]; [[lessen]]. -- To [[Abate]], [[Subside]]. These words, as here compared, [[imply]] a coming down from some previously raised or excited state. ''Abate'' expresses this in respect to degrees, and implies a [[diminution]] of force or of [[intensity]]; as, the storm ''abates'', the cold ''abates'', the force of the wind ''abates''; or, the wind ''abates'', a fever ''abates''. ''Subside'' (to settle down) has reference to a previous state of agitation or [[commotion]]; as, the waves ''subside'' after a storm, the wind ''subsides'' into a calm. When the words are used figuratively, the same distinction should be observed. If we [[conceive]] of a thing as having different degrees of intensity or strength, the word to be used is ''abate''. Thus we say, a man's anger ''abates'', the ardor of one's love ''abates'', "[[Winter's]] rage ''abates''". But if the image be that of a [[sinking]] down into quiet from preceding excitement or commotion, the word to be used is ''subside''; as, the tumult of the people ''subsides'', the public mind ''subsided'' into a calm. The same is the case with those emotions which are [[tumultuous]] in their nature; as, his passion ''subsides'', his joy quickly ''subsided'', his grief ''subsided'' into a pleasing [[melancholy]]. Yet if, in such cases, we were [[thinking]] of the degree of violence of the emotion, we might use ''abate''; as, his joy will ''abate'' in the progress of time; and so in other [[instances]].
