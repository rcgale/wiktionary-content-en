====Synonyms====
*To [[subside]]; [[decrease]]; [[intermit]]; [[decline]]; [[diminish]]; [[lessen]].
*[[Subside]]. These words, as here compared, [[imply]] a coming down from some previously raised or excited state. 
*'''Abate''' expresses this in respect to degrees, and implies a [[diminution]] of force or of [[intensity]]; as, the storm '''abates''', the cold '''abates''', the force of the wind '''abates'''; or, the wind '''abates''', a fever '''abates'''. 
*'''Subside''' (to settle down) has reference to a previous state of agitation or [[commotion]]; as, the waves '''subside''' after a storm, the wind '''subsides''' into a calm. 
*When the words are used figuratively, the same distinction should be observed. If we [[conceive]] of a thing as having different degrees of intensity or strength, the word to be used is '''abate'''. Thus we say, a man's anger '''abates''', the ardor of one's love '''abates''', "Winter's rage '''abates'''". But if the image be that of a [[sinking]] down into quiet from preceding excitement or commotion, the word to be used is '''subside'''; as, the tumult of the people '''subsides''', the public mind '''subsided''' into a calm. 
*The same is the case with those emotions which are [[tumultuous]] in their nature; as, his passion '''subsides''', his joy quickly '''subsided''', his grief '''subsided''' into a pleasing [[melancholy]]. Yet if, in such cases, we were [[thinking]] of the degree of violence of the emotion, we might use '''abate'''; as, his joy will '''abate''' in the progress of time; and so in other [[instances]].
