Term used to describe a sailing ship of war which carried her armament on two fully-armed decks. Usually additional guns were carried on the upper works (forecastle and quarterdeck) but this was not a continuous battery and so did not count.

Two-deckers ranged all the way from the small 40-gun [[fourth-rate]] up to 80- or even 90-gun ships, with the "[[seventy-four]]" being the archetype.
