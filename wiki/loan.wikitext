===Noun===
'''loan''' ([[loans]])

#A sum of money or other valuables or consideration which an individual, group or other legal entity [[borrow]]s from another individual, group or legal entity (this latter often being a financial institution) with the condition that it be returned or repaid at a later date (sometimes with [[interest]]). Occasionally [[collateral]] is required to assure that the [[borrower]] repays his or her [[debt]] or returns the consideration thus loaned. Most loans require some sort of positive (or at least a lack of negative) credit to be established by the borrower first. ''He got a five grand '''loan'''.''
