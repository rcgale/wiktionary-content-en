In the lesbian community, the term '''U-Haul''' is used to describe a relationship that becomes very close  very fast -- a pattern attributed [[stereotype|stereotypically]] to relationships between two women. 

The word [[U-Haul]] comes from the popular moving company, in reference to the couple moving in together after only a few dates. The expression may have been originated by comic [[Lea DeLaria]], who wrote the following joke in the early 1980s:

:''Q. What does a lesbian bring on a second date?''
:''A. A U-Haul.''
