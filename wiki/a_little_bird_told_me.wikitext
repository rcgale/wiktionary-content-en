==English==
=== Etymology ===
The phrase has a somewhat contentious origin, some attribute it to [[Ecclesiastes]] [[wikisource:Bible%2C_English%2C_King_James%2C_Ecclesiastes#Chapter_10|10:20]] "for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter."  While others beleive that it originates from the Dutch saying ''[[Er lif t'el baerd]]'' "I should betray another."  A third explanation is simply an allusion to [[carrier pigeon]]s or other such messanger birds.
{{idiom2}}
'''a little bird told me''' ''also sometimes: '''a little bird whispered in my ear'''''
# [[information]] which was [[gathered]] from a [[source]] not to be [[overtly]] [[exposed]]
#: ''Let's just say I know because '''a little bird told me'''.''
=== Usage ===
This phrase is often used more [[comically]] than [[seriously]], especially when the source of the information is obvious to both parties but neither is willing to say.
