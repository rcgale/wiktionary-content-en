==English==
===Etymology===
 Age from Old French aage, from V.L. *ætaticum (cf. Sp. edad, It. eta), from Latin: ætatem (nom. ætas), "period of life," from ævum "lifetime, eternity, age," from PIE base *aiw- "vital force, life, long life, eternity." Meaning "time something has lived, particular length or stage of life" is from c.1315, -less from Old English: -leas, from leas "free (from), devoid (of), false, feigned".

===Adjective===
'''Ageless''' (No comparative or superlative exists, since the word refers to eternity in its meaning.)

# Having existed for so great a period of time that one's longevity cannot be expressed.
# Continuing infinitely or indefinitely
