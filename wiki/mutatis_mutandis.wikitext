===Etymology===
Latin, "those things having been changed which were to be changed"; both words are from Latin '''[[mutare]]''', to change.  '''Mutatis''' is the [[ablative]] plural of the [[perfect passive participle]], and '''mutandis''' is the ablative plural of the [[future passive participle]] or [[gerundive]].

===Adverb===

'''''mutatis mutandis'''''<!--italicised bold--->

#Having [[change]]d what needed to be changed.

====Usage notes====
*'''''Mutatis mutandis''''' is used in English to draw the reader's attention to the differences between a statement and a similar but different earlier statement.
*As '''''mutatis mutandis''''' is a foreign phrase used in English, it is properly [[italicize]]d when written.
