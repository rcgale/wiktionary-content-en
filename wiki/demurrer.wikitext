   \De*mur"rer\,

==[[Noun]]==

1. One who demurs.

2. (Law) A stop or pause by a party to an action, for the
   judgment of the court on the question, whether, assuming
   the truth of the matter alleged by the opposite party, it
   is sufficient in law to sustain the action or defense, and
   hence whether the party resting is bound to answer or
   proceed further.

{Demurrer to evidence}, an exception taken by a party to the
   evidence offered by the opposite party, and an objecting
   to proceed further, on the allegation that such evidence
   is not sufficient in law to maintain the issue, and a
   reference to the court to determine the point. --Bouvier.
