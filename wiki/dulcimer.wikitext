#A stringed instrument, with strings stretched across a sounding board, usually trapezoidal.  It's played on the lap or horizontally on a table.  Some have their own legs.  These musical instruments are played by plucking on the strings (traditionally with a quill) or by tapping on them (in the case of the hammer dulcimers).
#:The two classes of dulcimer are the "Mountain" or "Appalacian" dulcimer (plucked and played with a quill, usually a goose quill) and the hammer dulcimer (played by tapping on the strings with small "hammers").  See also: [[zither]]
