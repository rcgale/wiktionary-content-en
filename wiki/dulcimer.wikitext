{{wikipedia}}
#{{music}} A stringed [[instrument]], with strings stretched across a [[sounding board]], usually [[trapezoid]]al.  It's played on the [[lap]] or horizontally on a table.  Some have their own legs.  These musical instruments are played by [[pluck]]ing on the strings (traditionally with a quill) or by [[tap]]ping on them (in the case of the hammer dulcimers).
#:The two classes of dulcimer are the "Mountain" or "Appalacian" dulcimer (plucked and played with a quill, usually a goose quill) and the hammer dulcimer (played by tapping on the strings with small "hammers").  See also: [[zither]]
