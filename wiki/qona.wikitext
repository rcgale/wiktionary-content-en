This is my name! I'm English and was named after a friend of my mother's whose aunt and uncle were missionaries in The Solomon Islands, probably late in the 19th century. It means 'Little Dove'and is pronounced 'quo-na'.  If anyone out there has any more info on the history of the name, I'd love to hear about it.
