===Suffix===
'''-or'''

# Suffix appended to words to create an agent noun, indicating a person who does something.
: English generally appends this suffix where Latin would do it--to the root of a Latin-type perfect passive participle.  For other words, English tends to use the suffix ''[[-er]]''.  Occasionally both are used (''computer'' vs. ''computor'').
