Braniac is a crude insult or nickname describing people who are intelligent.  It is often used in association with the nouns geek and nerd (by modern definition), and is a synonym for the adjective brainy.  Braniac is not proper English, and is a mockery of the thought that those who are smarter have larger brains.  Somewhat similar to the term "one brain", braniac was most likely developed by school children.  

The term "one brain" is often used by middle school and junior high students. It refers to a common thought between one or more people. For example, if person A says "I'm really hungry," and that is what person B was thinking, person B would say "one brain". If the two people said the same thing simultaneously, they might both say "one brain". The phrase is often shortened to "OB" for convenience. "One Brain" derived from Hope Fiori and Erin Sadler and was inspired by the way they seemed to share components of the same brain because they are so alike  Soon picked up by their best friends Laura Millet and Emily Reardon, it quickly spread throughout their community and was passed down through oral tradition. Hope, Erin, Laura, and Emily currently reside in a small, quaint town in New England.
