* '''Other info''':  The Kun reading /uma/ may be used alone as a word for [[horse]] or as part of another word.  The On reading is usually part of a word, for example [[乗馬]] (じょうば /zyooba/ "horseback riding") or [[駟馬]] (しめ /sime/ or しば /siba/ "a set of four horses for drawing a carriage"). /ma-/ is not an On reading and is rather a bound morpheme attested since the Old Japanese period. It has not appeared alone as a free word since the earliest Japanese anthology, the Manyoshu, but it still lingers on in Modern Japanese in such forms as /ma-gusa/ (hay; fodder for horses or cattle) and /ma-guso/ (horse droppings). As for the etymological relationship between the Japanese Kun readings, the form /uma/ has probably evolved from an older form /mima/, which is actually attested in compounds and names of Emperors in Old Japanese and still appears in toponyms (placenames) even today. /mima/ itself was probably a compound of the Old Japanese honorific prefix /mi-/, which had the same function as Modern Japanese /o-/, and the original Japanese root for "horse," i.e. */ma/. In the same manner as */mi-ma/ became fossilized as /mima/ and later eroded into /muma/ or /uma/, the Chinese loanword /tya/ (tea) has been prefixed with the more recent Japanese honorific prefix /o-/ and become fixed as /o-tya/(pronounced "ocha") no matter whether a speaker really wants to indicate respect toward the tea or its provider. No one says just /tya/ ("cha") in Modern Japanese, just as no one says just /ma-/; one has to say "uma."
