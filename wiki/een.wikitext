'''Een''' 

== Dutch ==

# /ən/, ''indefinite article'', placed before a singular noun, indicating a general case of a person or thing: [[a]], [[an]]. Compare with [[de]] and [[het]].
# [e:n], ''number'', [[one]]

=== Usage notes ===

#
# When it is clear from the context that 'een' is the number, not the indefinite article, it is written without the accents acutes; in all other cases with. For instance, 'one of those' is written ''een van die''. In case the word must be written with accents and starts the sentence, the first letter is left unaccented, as in the example below.

=== Examples === 

# ''Een hoed'': a hat; ''een oor''; an ear.
# ''Eén voor allen, allen voor één'': one for all, all for one. (The motto of [[w:The Three Musketeers]].)
