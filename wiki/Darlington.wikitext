=== Etymology ===
From {{AS.}} [[Dearthington]] believed to be ''the settlement of Deornoth's people'' (unclear root + [[ing]] ''a family group'' + [[ton]] ''an enclosed farm or homestead'') via {{ME.}} [[Dearnington]] and [[Derlinton]].  The family name is derived from the place name, simply meaning one who came from the village of Darlington.  Most of the later place names are derived either from the Darlington family name, being named either after people with that family name, or are derived from the place name directly, being named after the original village of Darlington directly.
