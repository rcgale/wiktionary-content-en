===Etymology===
The name "Duck" tape was used in World War II soon after its introduction.  It is said to be named after the expression "like water off a duck's back" meaning waterproof.  It may also have something to do with the amphibious vehicle called a DUKW but pronounced "duck", which was useful in part because they were well-stocked with every tool and implement&mdash;including the new waterproof cloth tape?

After the war, it was manufactured in silver instead of green, and was used for constructing folded sheetmetal ductwork; hense the form "duct tape".
