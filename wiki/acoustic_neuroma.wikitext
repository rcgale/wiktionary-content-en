An acoustic neuroma is a benign tissue growth situated in the hearing canal. It is sometimes referred to as a vestibular schwannoma or neurinoma. It grows very slowly, pressing on the hearing and balance nerves and possibly causing pressure on the base of the brain in larger tumours.  It is one of many types of tumours that may occur in the cranium.
