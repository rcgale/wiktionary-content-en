#A star that has been so collapsed by gravity that it does not have [[electron]]s or [[proton]]s, since they have been merged into neutrons by the intense [[pressure]].  As a result, it is a solid mass of [[neutron]]s that is only held apart by the natural strength of the neutrons.  If the mass is sufficient, the neutron star collapses into a [[black hole]] and becomes a point of infinitely dense matter.  The material of a neutron star is sometimes called [[neutronium]], since it lacks anything save neutrons.
