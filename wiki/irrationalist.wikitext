'''''Irrationalist''''' is a wide term. It may be applied to mean ''one without [[rationality]]'', for their beliefs or ideas. Or, more precisely, it may mean someone who rejects some aspect of [[rationalism]], variously defined. For example [[religious faith]] may be seen as, in part, a rejection of complete rationalism about the world; this would be contested by some religious thinkers, in that the ''rational'' is a debatable term. On the other hand, it might be considered irrationalist to buy a [[lottery ticket]], just on the basis that winning is highly unlikely.

Irrational thought was seen in Europe as part of the reaction against [[Continental rationalism]]. For example [[Hamann]] is sometimes classified as an irrationalist.
