==English==

===Etymology===
From [[God]]'s [[blood]]; in [[medieval]] times, people would curse on God's body parts rather than breaking the [[w:Ten commandments|third commandment]] (Do not use the Lord's name in [[vain]] [[oath]]s).  In this case, the exclamation refers to [[Christ]]'s blood shed during the [[crucifixion]] and commemorated by the drinking of [[wine]] during [[communion]].  Compare [[strewth]], [[blimey]], [[zounds]].

===Interjection===
''''sblood!'''
# ''Archaic'' An exclamation formerly used as an oath, and an expression of anger or wonder.
