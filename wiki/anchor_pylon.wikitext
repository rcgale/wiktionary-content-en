'''Anchor pylons''' or '''strainer pylons''' utilize horizontal [[insulators]] and occur at the endpoints of [[conductors]].  Such endpoints are necessary when interfacing with other modes of power transmission and when significantly altering the direction of the [[pylon]] chain, due to the inflexibility of the conductors. Anchor pylons are also employed at branch points and must occur at a maximum interval of 5 km, due to technical limitations on conductor length. Conductors are connected at such pylons by a short conductor cable "strained" between both ends. They often require [[anchor]] cables to compensate for the [[asymmetric]] attachment of the conductors.  Therefore, anchor pylons tend to be more stably built than a support pylon and are often used, particularly in older construction, when the power line must cross a large gap, such as a [[railway]] line, [[river]], or [[valley]].
