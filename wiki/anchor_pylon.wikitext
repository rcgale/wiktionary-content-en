'''Anchor pylons''' or '''strainer pylons''' utilize horizontal [[insulators]] and occur at the endpoints of [[conductor (material)|conductor]]s.  Such endpoints are necessary when interfacing with other modes of power transmission (see image) and, due to the inflexibility of the conductors, when significantly altering the direction of the [[pylon]] chain. Anchor pylons are also employed at branch points as [[branch pylon]]s and must occur at a maximum interval of 5 km, due to technical limitations on conductor length. Conductors are connected at such pylons by a short conductor cable "strained" between both ends. They often require [[anchor]] cables to compensate for the [[asymmetric]] attachment of the conductors.  Therefore, anchor pylons tend to be more stably built than a support pylon and are often used, particularly in older construction, when the power line must cross a large gap, such as a [[railway]] line, [[river]], or [[valley]].
A special kind of an anchor pylon is a '''termination pylon'''. It is used for the transition of an overhead powerline to an underground cable. A termination pylon, at which the powerline runs further as well as overhead line and as underground cable is a branch pylon for a cable branch.
For voltages below 30kV also [[pylon transformer]]s are used.
'''Twisted pylons''' are anchor pylons at which the conductors are "twisted" so that they exchange sides of the pylon.
Anchor pylons may also have a [[circuit breaker]] attached to their crossbeam. These so called '''switch pylons''' are operated from the ground by the use of long sticks.  The attachment of circuit breakers to pylons is only practical when voltages are less than 50kV.
