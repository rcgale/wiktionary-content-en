==English==
===Etymology===
after [[physicist]] [[w:James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[demon]], and probably from Greek [[daemon]], a mythological being intermediate between gods and men
===Noun===
'''Maxwell's demon'''
#A [[hypothetical]] creature created for a [[thought experiment]].  Maxwell's demon, if it existed, would act as a sort of gate guard by sorting between higher-energy molecules and lower-energy molecules within an enclosed space.  Because such a sorting process would tend to decrease [[entropy]], it would violate the second law of [[thermodynamics]].
