{{wikipedia}}
#A [[hypothetical]] creature created for a [[thought experiment]].  Maxwell's demon, if it existed, would act as a sort of gate guard by sorting between higher-energy molecules and lower-energy molecules within an enclosed space.  Because such a sorting process would tend to decrease [[entropy]], it would violate the second law of [[thermodynamics]].
