'''Systems design''' is the process or art of defining the [[hardware]] and [[software]] architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and [[data]] for a [[computer system]] to satisfy specified [[requirement]]s. One could see it as the application of [[systems theory]] to [[computing]]. Some overlap with the discipline of [[systems analysis]] appears inevitable.

Prior to the [[standardisation]] of hardware and software in the 1990s which resulted in the ability to build [[modular]] systems, systems design had a more crucial and respected role in the [[data processing]] industry. The increasing importance of software running on generic platforms have enhanced the discipline of [[software engineering]] at systems design's expense.

Design tools such as [[Unified Modeling Language | UML]] now address some of the issues of computer systems design and interfacing.
