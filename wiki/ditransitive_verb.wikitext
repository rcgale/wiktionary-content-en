===Noun===
'''[[ditransitive]] [[verb]]'''

#{{Grammar}}: A verb that requires (in the unmarked form) both a [[direct object]] and an [[indirect object]] so as to be [[grammatical]].
#:Example: 'give' requires both a gift and a receiver, as in 'give the dog a bone'. Neither 'give the dog' nor 'give a bone' are grammatically complete.
#:Note: "I donâ€™t give a hoot" is not considered the unmarked form.
