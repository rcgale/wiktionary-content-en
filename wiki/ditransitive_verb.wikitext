===Noun===

'''[[ditransitive]] [[verb]]'''
#(''Grammar'') A verb that requires (in the unmarked form) both a [[direct object]] and an [[indirect object]] so as to be [[grammatical]]. 
#:E.g. 'give' requires both a gift and a receiver as in 'give the dog a bone'. Neither 'give the dog' nor 'give the bone' are grammatical. 
#:Note: "I don't give a (insert expletive here)" is not considered the unmarked form.
