A '''Dutchophone''' is a person who speaks the [[Dutch language]] either natively or by adoption. As an adjective, the word means "Dutch-speaking."

Dutchophone areas include [[The Netherlands]] (where the language originates), the [[Flanders]] region of [[Belgium]], the [[Caribbean]] islands of the [[Netherlands Antilles]] and [[Aruba]] (both Dutch territories), and the independent [[South America]]n nation of [[Suriname]], a former colony of the Netherlands. There are also some Dutchophones living in northern [[France]], near the Belgian border, and some very small groups in [[Indonesia]], another former Dutch colony.

There are an estimated 21 million Dutchophones world-wide.
