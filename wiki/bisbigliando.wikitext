'''Bisbigliando''' ("whispering" in [[Italian]]) is a special [[tremolo]] effect on the [[harp]] where a [[chord]] or [[note]] is played quickly over and over again.
Usually, it is with both hands playing different strings but the same [[pitch (music)|pitch]]es.  This is possible because of enharmonic spellings created by the pedals.
It can sound like strumming a guitar or even "watery".

On sheet music, it is represented by three thick lines connecting the notes to be trilled.
