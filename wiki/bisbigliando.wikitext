'''Bisbigliando''' ("whispering" in [[Italian]]) is a special [[tremolo]] effect on the [[harp]] where a [[chord]] or [[note]] is rapidly repeated at a low volume. Usually, the effect is achieved by both hands playing adjecent strings set to the same [[pitch (music)|pitch]]es.  This is possible because of enharmonic spellings created by the pedals.
It can sound like strumming a [[guitar]] or even "watery".

On [[sheet music]], it is represented by three thick lines connecting the notes to be trilled.
