'''Burbled''' is a word probably invented by [[Lewis Carroll]] and used in his poem ''[[Jabberwocky]]''.   However Collins English Dictionary suggests that it was used in Fourteenth Century English.

The word is used in the sentence "and ''burbled'' as it came," meaning bubbled or babbled.

Often used in the phrase ==Burbled O== meaning meaning the mindless repitition of some point long after the speaker has lost his/her audience.   The question  "What are you burbling on about?" sometimes serves as a semi-tactful suggestion that it is time for a person to stop talking.

More recently, '''burble''' has been commonly adopted as an [[onomatopoeia]] for the exhaust note of a [[V8]] [[internal-combustion engine|engine]].
