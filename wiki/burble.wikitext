'''Burbled''' is a word best known from its use in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s poem ''[[Jabberwocky]]'' and is often supposed to have been invented by him. Carroll seems to have thought so himself. According to Alexander L. Taylor, in a letter to a child-friend Carroll wrote that

:If you take the three verbs '<u>b</u>leat,' 'm<u>ur</u>mur,' and 'war<u>ble</u>,' and select the bits I have underlined, it certainly ''makes'' 'burble,' although I am afraid I can't distinctly remember having made it in that way.

However, Collins English Dictionary suggests that it was used in Fourteenth Century English, and the American Heritage Dictionary cites derivation from Middle English ''burblen,'' to bubble (and does not mention Carroll).

The word is used in the sentence "and ''burbled'' as it came," meaning bubbled or babbled.

Often used in the phrase ==Burbled O== meaning meaning the mindless repitition of some point long after the speaker has lost his/her audience.   The question  "What are you burbling on about?" sometimes serves as a semi-tactful suggestion that it is time for a person to stop talking.

More recently, '''burble''' has been commonly adopted as an [[onomatopoeia]] for the exhaust note of a [[V8]] [[internal-combustion engine|engine]].
