The term "occult" has noble, but largely forgotten origins. Derived from the Latin occultus meaning 'hidden,' it properly defines anything which is undisclosed, concealed, or not easily perceived. . . . 
Writing a century ago, when the word had not acquired today's mixed connotations, [[H. P. Blavatsky]] defined occultism as "[[altruism]] pure and simple" -- the divine wisdom or hidden theosophy within all religions. Occultism is founded on the principle that Divinity is concealed -- transcendent yet immanent -- within every living being. As a spiritual discipline occultism is the renunciation of selfishness; it is the "still small path" which leads to wisdom, to the right discrimination between good and evil, and the practice of altruism.
