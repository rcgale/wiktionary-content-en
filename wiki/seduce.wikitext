1. To draw away from proper conduct: corrupt.   2. To persuade or entice to have sexual intercourse. (Taken from Webster's II. Copyright 1984.)

An individual seduces another person by tapping into their desire for money, sex, and power - among other things. To seduce, a person will often use mental tricks or manipulation. The individual being seduced will succumb if they believe the object of desire is worth persuing. Seduction can have positive or negative consequences.
