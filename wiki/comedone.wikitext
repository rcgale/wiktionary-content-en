# Non-inflammatory acne lesion. There are three types of comedones. The microcomedo is a clinically invisible accumulation of corneocytes in the follicular canal. The microcomedo is the original acne lesion. The closed comedone (whitehead) evolves from the microcomedo and appears as a white dot. The open comedone (blackhead) appears as a dark-topped dot.
