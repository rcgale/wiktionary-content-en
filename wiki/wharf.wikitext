===Noun===
'''wharf''' (plural: [[wharfs]] or [[wharves]])

# A man-made landing place jutting out to sea or by a river. (The fact that wharfs often have warehouses next to them for storing unloaded goods has led to the popular etymology that 'wharf' is an acronym of 'warehouse at river front'; however this is not correct. The word comes from an Old German word for a wharf or dockyard.)
