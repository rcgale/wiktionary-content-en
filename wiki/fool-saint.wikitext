A '''fool saint''' is a [[role model]], or a figure in someone's life who is admired. This fool-saint is a person that, in the eyes of the beholder, is a perfect person because he or she is admired so much. In [[Robertson Davies]]' [[Media:Fifth Business|Fifth Business]], Mary Dempster is a fool-saint for Dunstable Ramsay.
