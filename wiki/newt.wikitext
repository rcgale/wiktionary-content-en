===Etymology===
From the older form [[eft]], which became ''euft'' and then ''ewt''; the ''n'' comes from hearing "an ewt" as "a newt".  Compare [[apple]], [[nickname]], [[orange]], [[ox]].

t is interesting. The oldest form of the name is eft, which is still used for some varieties, but according to the Oxford English Dictionary it changed for unknown reasons first to euft and then to ewt. For some time then it was an ewt, but then the N moved over and it became a newt. See A, an for other examples.

====Synonyms====
*[[eft]] (''archaic or dialect, or used for some varieties'')
