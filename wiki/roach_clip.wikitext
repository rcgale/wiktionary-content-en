A '''roach clip''' is a [[clip]], or holder, that is attached to a cigarette (usually a marijuana cigarette), also known as a  "roach" or "[[joint]]". Its purpose is to let the smoker smoke the last bit of the "roach" without burning his lips, and to facilitate passing around the "roach" without dropping it.

The "classic" or most familiar roach clip is the surgical [[hemostat]], essentially a lightweight needle nose plier with loop handles  and an ability to lock closed, originally designed to clamp closed blood vessels during surgery. Their size (usually four or six inches in length) and shape (available with straight or bent tip) makes them ideal for holding the burning end of a joint -- a marijuana cigarette -- to the lips without burning them. They are popular enough as "roach clips" to be sold at "[[head shop]]s", or purveyors of drug paraphernalia.

Another popular type of roach clip is the [[alligator clip]]. Alligator clips are generally smaller in size (from one to three inches) than hemostats, but like hemostats they have the feature (in this case provided by the force of a spring) of being able to clamp onto the roach without any sustained effort on the part of the smoker.

Some choose to go the makeshift route, and use very common household items such as paperclips, often when the better alternatives listed above are unavailable.

Most naturally fitting the bill as a roach "clip" is the [[cigarette]] [[cigarette holder|holder]].
