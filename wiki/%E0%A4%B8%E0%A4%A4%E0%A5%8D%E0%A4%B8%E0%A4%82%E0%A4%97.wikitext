The company of the highest knowledge and Truth; the company of a [[Guru]]; contact with a person or an assembly of persons who listen to, talk about, and assimilate the [[Dhamma|Truth]]. This highest company also takes the form of hearing or reading the words of highest awareness, reflecting on, discussing and assimilating their meaning, [[meditation|meditating]] on the source of these words, and bringing this awareness into one’s daily life.

From Siree Raag Mahala 1, 71, Guru Granth Sahib: 

''How is the Society of the Saints to be known?''

''There, the Name of the One Lord is chanted.''

''The One Name is the Lord's Command; O Nanak, the True Guru has given me this understanding. ||5||''
