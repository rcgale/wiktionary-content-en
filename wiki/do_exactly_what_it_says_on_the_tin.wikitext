'''"Does exactly what it says on the tin"''' is a popular phrase in the [[United Kingdom]], which originated in a series of [[television commercials]] by the woodstain and wood-dye manufacturer Ronseal, initiated in the late [[1980s]] and still running [[as of 2004]]. The idea of the phrase was to emphasise that the company's products would act and last for the amount of time exactly as described on the tin. The expression quickly entered British [[popular culture]], used to describe anything that is exactly as it appears or claims to be, or is particularly simple or straight-forward.
