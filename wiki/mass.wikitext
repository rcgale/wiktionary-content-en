===Etymology 1===
Old English. ''[[masse]]'', ''[[messe]]'', Anglo Saxon ''mæsse''. Late Latin ''[[missa]]'', from Latin ''[[mittere]]'', ''[[missum]]'', to send, dismiss: compare French ''messe''. 
In the ancient churches, the public services at which the catechumens were permitted to be present were called ''[[missa catechumenorum]]'', ending with the reading of the Gospel. Then they were dismissed with these words : "Ite, missa est", the congregation is dismissed. After that the sacrifice proper began. At its close the same words were said to those who remained. So the word gave the name of Mass to the sacrifice in the Catholic Church. See [[Missile]], and compare [[Christmas]], [[Lammas]], [[Mess a dish]], [[Missal]]

====Noun====
'''mass'''
#''(Roman Catholic Church):'' The principal [[liturgical]] service of the Church, including a scripture service and a [[eucharistic service]], which includes the [[consecration]] and [[oblation]] (offering) of the [[host]] and wine.  Also called the ''[[Eucharist]]'', ''[[Eucharistic sacrifice]]'', [[divine liturgy]], or ''[[Eucharistic]] [[liturgy]]''. It is considered one of the seven [[sacrament]]s.
#''(Music)'' The portions of the Mass usually set to music, considered as a musical composition.  Traditionally these were divided into the parts that did not change (the [[Ordinary]]), and the parts that did change (the [[Proper]]).  Most commonly a musical Mass contained the Ordinary, which included the [[Kyrie]], [[Gloria]], [[Credo]], [[Sanctus]], [[Benedictus]], and [[Agnus Dei]].  Compositions for funeral Masses included several additional Proper parts, such as the [[Dies Irae]].  Modern liturgical Masses since the Second Vatican Council also may include [[General Intercessions]], [[Memorial Acclamation]], and [[Great Amen]].

#:'''Note''' Mass and weight are often used, in a general way, as interchangeable terms, since the weight of a body is proportional to its mass (under the same or equal gravitative forces), and the mass is usually ascertained from the weight. Yet the two ideas, mass and weight, are quite distinct. Mass is the quantity of matter in a body; weight is the comparative force with which it tends towards the center of the earth. A mass of sugar and a mass of lead are assumed to be equal when they show an equal weight by balancing each other in the scales
