'''Ё''', '''ё''' (''italics: Ё, ё'')

#The seventh letter of the Russian [[Cyrillic]] alphabet. Its name is '''ё''' (jo) and it has the sound of '''yo''' in '''''Yo'''rk''. This letter invariably bears the word stress. However, the [[diaeresis]] is rarely used except in dictionaries and children’s books, and the letter is usually written simply as '''е'''. It is preceded by [[е|Е]] and followed by [[ж|Ж]].
