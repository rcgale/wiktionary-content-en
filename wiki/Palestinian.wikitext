===Adjective===
#Of, from, or pertaining to Palestine, or the Palestinian people.  Note: Prior to 1948, "Palestinian" often referred to Jewish institutions in the British Mandate of Palestine.  For example, today's English-language Israeli newspaper The Jerusalem Post was called The Palestine Post before 1948; also the Palestinian Orchestra was a Jewish orchestra.  Today, "Palestinian" refers almost exclusively to Arabs who claim part of the land now controlled by Israel as a homeland.
