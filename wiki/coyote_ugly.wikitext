===Etymology===
Folk etymology: Trappers in early America would often find a coyote foot in their traps; the coyote would be so desperate to escape they presumably chewed their own limb off.  In the 1970s, a comedian may have coined the term as a method of escaping from a drunken one night stand, the morning after (without waking her up.)
