A '''treasury tag''' is a short piece of [[string|cord]], with [[metal]] bars at each end. It is used in [[office]]s for holding papers together or fastening them into a [[file (paper)|file]]: one bar is pushed through punched holes, then the bars rest horizontally on either side of the papers so that they cannot come apart.
