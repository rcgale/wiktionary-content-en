'''herfst'''

== Dutch == 

/hERfst/

===Etymology===
From ''[[herfstmaand]]''; related to High German ''[[Herbst]]'', English ''[[harvest]]'', Latin ''[[carpere]]'' (to [[pick]], to [[pluck]]), Greek ''[[karpos]]'' ([[tree-fruit]]). The original meaning is ''harvest time''.

===Meanings===
====noun====
''plural'' -en /-@n/
#traditionally the third of the four [[season]]s, normally on the northern hemisphere from [[September]] 21 to [[December]] 20; [[autumn]], [[fall]].

=== Usage ===
The made-up compound noun ''herfstschrik'' (/hERfstsxRIk/, fear of fall?) is used to demonstrate the bewildering number of consonants that can be strung together in Dutch. It is not particularly difficult for a speaker of Dutch to pronounce all consonants, but in practice a few of these will be dropped to something like /hERfsxRIk/.
