'''herfst'''

== Dutch == 

/hERfst/

''noun'', ''plural'' -en /-@n/, traditionally the third of the four [[season]]s, normally on the northern hemisphere from [[September]] 21 to [[December]] 20; [[autumn]], [[fall]].

=== Usage ===

The made-up compound noun ''herfstschrik'' (/hERfstsxRIk/, fear of fall?) is used to demonstrate the bewildering number of consonants that can be strung together in Dutch. In practice, a speaker of Dutch will drop a few of these in pronunciation to something like /hERfsxRIk/, although it is possible to pronounce all consonants.
