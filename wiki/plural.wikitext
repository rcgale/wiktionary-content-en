==English==
===Etymology===
From Latin ''[[pluralis]]'', [[adjective]] from ''[[plus]]'', ''[[pluris]]'', '''[[more]]''', + adjective [[suffix]] ''[[-alis]]''

===Noun===
# a word in the form in which it potentially refers to something other than one person or thing; and other than two things if the language has a ''[[dual]]'' form.
:Note:  Many languages have [[singular]] and plural forms for one item or more than one item.  Some have a singular form for one, [[dual]] form for two, and plural for more than two (e.g., [[Anglo-Saxon]], [[Hebrew]]).
:Note: While the plural form generally refers to two or more persons or things, that it is not always the case. The plural form is often used for [[zero]] persons or things, for fractional things in a quanity greater than one, and for people or things when the quantity is unknown.
