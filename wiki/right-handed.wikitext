A person who is '''right-handed''' is more dextrous with his or her right hand than with their left hand: they will write with their right hand, and probably also use this hand for tasks such as personal care, cooking, and so on. Approximately 90% of the population is right-handed, while most of the remaining are [[left-handed]]. A very small percentage of the population can use both hands equally well; a person with this ability is deemed to be [[ambidextrous]].

Throughout history being right-handed was considered as normal - the Latin word ''dexter'' meant "right" and is associated with skill. Hence the many prejudicial connotations became associated with right handedness: skillful, diligent, dextrous, deft. The associated left brain hemisphere that is said to be more active in right-handed people, has been found to be correlated with linguistic and logical skill.
