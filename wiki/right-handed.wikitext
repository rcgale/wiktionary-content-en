A person who is '''right-handed''' is more dextrous with their [[Left and right|right]] [[hand]] than with their [[Left and right|left]] hand: they will write with their right hand, and probably also use this hand for tasks such as personal care, cooking, and so on. Approximately 90% of the [[population]] is right-handed, while most of the remaining are [[left-handed]]. A very small percentage of the population can use both hands equally well; a person with this ability is deemed to be [[ambidextrous]].

Throughout history being right-handed was considered normal (the [[Latin]] word ''dexter'' meant "right" and is associated with skill). Hence the many prejudicial connotations became associated with right handedness: skilful, diligent, dextrous, deft. The associated left brain hemisphere that is said to be more active in right-handed people, has been found to be correlated with linguistic and logical skill.

In [[German]] schools decades ago and in some American schools, left handed children were forced to write right-handed.
