'''Prydain''' is the [[Welsh]] name of the island of [[Britain]].

In mediaeval texts (e.g. the [[Mabinogion]]), the term often refers to the northenmost part of the island, beyond the [[Forth]] and [[Clyde]]: where the island as a whole is meant, the phrase ''Ynys Prydain'' (Isle of Prydain) is commonly used. Compare [[Albion]] and [[Alba]] for a similar distinction.

The name has been used by a number of authors for ancient Celtic or fantasy lands, including [[Stephen Lawhead]]'s Celtic Trilogy and [[Lloyd Alexander]]'s [[Chronicles of Prydain]].
