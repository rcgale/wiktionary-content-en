===Noun===
#An evergreen shrub, of the genus ''[[Laurus]] (L. nobilis)'', having aromatic leaves of a [[lanceolate]] shape, with clusters of small, yellowish white flowers in their [[axils]]; -- called also sweet bay. The fruit is a purple berry. It is found about the Mediterranean, and was early used by the ancient Greeks to crown the [[victor]] in the games of Apollo. At a later period, academic [[honor]]s were indicated by a crown of laurel, with the fruit. The leaves and tree yield an [[aromatic]] oil, used to flavor the bay water of commerce.
#:'''Note:''' The name is extended to other plants which in some respect resemble the true laurel.
#A [[crown]] of laurel; hence, honor; distinction; fame; -- especially in the plural; as, to win laurels.
#An English gold [[coin]] made in 1619, and so called because the king's [[head]] on it was crowned with laurel
