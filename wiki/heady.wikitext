The word heady roots from head, which in Gangsta Hippie terms, is used in conjunction with stash - or Head Stash. Head Stash means a personal holding of "party supplies." Generally speaking, a Head Stash's "elements" are quite good. Eventually, people on Lot, sick of "regs," and started directly asked for "headies." Soon enough, everyone was rocking "headies." And since headies are good... Heady meant "good" and heady became a word.
