'''Ginny''' is a short form of the name [[Virginia]] and somewhat less prone to cruel [[nicknames]].

This form of the name seems to be becoming more common after its use as the name of the youngest [[Weasley]] child in the [[Harry Potter]] books, though [[J. K. Rowling]] revealed [[Ginny Weasley]]'s full name is Ginevra, not Virginia, on her [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=7  website]. Real people named Ginny include [[Ginny Owens]] and [[Ginny Brown-Waite]]

"Ginny" is also the [[adjective]] for [[gin]].
