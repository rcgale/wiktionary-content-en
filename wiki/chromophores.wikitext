=== Noun ===
'''chromophore'''
#The chemical group that gives color to a molecule.
#''(Chemistry,Physics)'': An unsaturated group in a molecule which has a potentiality for colour. Ie, absorbs light in a characteristic region of the visible spectrum and is largely independant of the rest of the molecule. Eg, N=N in ''azo dyes''. In azo dyes molecules contain a conjugated system of electrons. The colour is due to the prescence of the N=N chromophore linking two aromatic groups. The chromophore absorbs light from the visible spectrum, principally in the blue region to give blrightly coloured azo dyes in the organge and red region. The shade obtained depends on the use of aromatic moleuces with different groups substituted on the benzene ring.
