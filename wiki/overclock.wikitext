=== Verb ===

To run a [[processor]] ([[CPU]]), or any electronic logic device, at a speed higher than is reccomended by the manufacturer. For a PC, this is normally done by changing settings both on the [[motherboard]] and also the [[BIOS]].

Overclocking can cause a computer to crash frequently and may also dammage or burn-out the processor.
