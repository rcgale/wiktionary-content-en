Note: As a pronoun another may have a possessive another's, pl. others, poss. pl. other'. It is much used in opposition to one; as, one went one way, another another. It is also used with one, in a reciprocal sense; as, "love one another," that is, let each love the other or others. ''These two imparadised in one another's arms.''&mdash;Milton.
