'''Embonpoint''' is an amalgam of the [[French]] words ''en'', ''bon'', and ''point'', meaning literally "in good condition."  It denotes [[stout]]ness or [[plump]]ness in a person.

As in ''She was one of those women who, inclined to embonpoint, have round smooth wrinkleless faces until they die.'' ~ Blackwood Farm, by Anne Rice.
