====Usage notes====
*The term '''average''' may refer to the statistical [[mean]], [[median]] or [[mode]] of a distribution, or sometimes any other [[measure of central tendency]].  Statisticians and responsible news sources are careful to use whichever of these specific terms is appropriate.  In common usage, '''average''' refers to the [[arithmetic mean]].  It is, however, a common rhetorical trick to call the most favorable of mean, median and mode the "average" depending on the interpretation of a set of figures that the speaker or writer wants to promote.
