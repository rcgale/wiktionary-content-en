A '''fiasco''' (pl. '''fiascoes''') means a complete or ridiculous failure, especially of a pretentious undertaking. (The word is originally [[Italian language|Italian]] and means a rounded wine bottle, sometimes wrapped by a straw basked, such as used traditionally for the [[Chianti]] wine.)

''Fiasco'' is the [[English language|English]] title of a [[science fiction]] novel by [[Stanislaw Lem]]. It tells about an expedition sent to a distant star in order to make contact with a civilization that had been detected there. The attempt ends, as the title promises, in complete failure.

==Some famous fiascoes==

*The [[Mongol]]s first attempt at invading [[Japan]] -- see [[Kamikaze]]. 
*The [[Iridium (satellite)|Iridium]] project.
*The [[dot-com]] bubble.
