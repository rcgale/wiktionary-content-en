[[da:Fiasko]]

A '''fiasco''' (pl. '''fiascoes''') means a complete or ridiculous failure, especially of a pretentious undertaking. 

The word is originally [[Italian language|Italian]] and means a rounded wine bottle, sometimes wrapped by a straw basked, such as used traditionally for the [[Chianti]] wine. The metaphorical connection is "they wanted the wine but all they got was an empty bottle."
