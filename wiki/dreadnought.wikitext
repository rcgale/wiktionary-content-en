'''dreadnought'''

# a [[battleship]] in which most of the firepower is concentrated in large guns that are of the same caliber. Before completion of the British battleship Dreadnought in 1906, battleships had two or four guns of the largest caliber, usually 11 inches or greater, and a large array of smaller, quick-firing guns. This pre-Dreadnought approach made accurate long-range naval gunnery much more difficult, because the different guns had different ballistic characteristics. The Dreadnought type's standardization of the main battery made accurate long-range fire much easier. Also, shells from the heavier guns were more likely to penetrate the target ship's armor. Whether or not to go to an all big-gun ship was hotly debated among naval experts until Japanese battleships soundly defeated a Russian fleet in the Battle of Tsushima in 1905, mainly by relatively long-range gunnery with the largest caliber guns.
