===Verb===
'''repent'''

# change one's mind, rethink, regret or be sorry for past sins

====Etymology====
There seems to be considerable difference of opinion about the derivation of ''repent''.  Most sources trace it back to French ''[[repentir]]'', from prefix ''[[re-]]'', '''again''' + Latin ''[[poenitere]]'', related to ''[[poena]]'', '''pain'''.  It seems to be unrelated to French ''[[penser]]'', '''think''', which comes from ''[[pensare]]'', '''weigh out'''.
