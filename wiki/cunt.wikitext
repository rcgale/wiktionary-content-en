''Usage Note:''  '''''Cunt,''''' in definitions 2 & 3 above, if used by an adult, would generally only be used at, or (more likely) used to indirectly refer to, another adult; almost never would it be used directly by an adult to an adolescent (except, perhaps, to an adolescent not too far removed in age from the person using the word), and seldom would it be used to indirectly refer to an adolescent (with the same aforementioned exception); and would almost never be used directly at, or used to refer to, a pre-adolescent child, due to the word's taboo nature.  (Such use ''at'' a child by an adult, indeed, could virtually be taken as a form of child abuse.)  An adolescent bold enough to use the word may use it to indirectly refer to both adults and other adolescents; might use it directly to another adolescent; might use it indirectly to refer to an adult; would rarely be caught using it directly to an adult; and would generally not use it directly or indirectly at pre-adolescent children.  Finally, rarely would a pre-adolescent child be found using this word at all, due to the fact that such children will generally be shielded from this word, and as such, this word won't generally be part of a pre-adolescent child's vocabulary.

'''Etymology'''

Orig. a sheepskin pouch soaked in oil used to carry a long sharpening stone (for sharpening shears, scythes etc). The sheepskin would be soaked, turned inside out, and the sharpening stone withdrawn and inserted during use. The graphical connotations being obvious, the word was quickly adopted for other meanings, as above.
