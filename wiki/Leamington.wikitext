Renowned as "The Tomato Capital" of Canada, the Leamington area is rich in a multitude of crops which are grown not only to supply the local processing industries, but are in abundant supply in roadside stands for all to enjoy. Tomatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes and flowers are the main greenhouse crops, with more than 800 acres "under glass"â€¦you will notice that they are an important part of the local landscape. Other vegetables, including asparagus, beans, sweet corn, onions, lettuce, celery, carrots, zucchini, peppers, melons, squash, potatoes and more all grow well because of its "southern latitude"! Fruits of all types also abound - peaches, grapes, apples and strawberries are all grown locally. It has been said that if it doesn't grow in Leamington, it doesn't grow anywhere else in Canada!
