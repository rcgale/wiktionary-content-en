===Noun===
'''return'''  (''plural:'' [[returns]])
#{{cattag|Computing}}: A character that indicates a new line.  Hexadecimal %x0d, decimal 13.  <!--Move to etymology?-->Old typewriters had a carraige that lined up the paper with the printing strike-arms; with the advent of electronic typewriters, the "carraige return" key would realign the printing at the left margin, and advance to a new line.  Early computers added <CR><LF> (13,10) to indicate a new line, with variations such as <LF> (10), <CR> (13) and even the evil <LF><CR> (10,13)!  Modern computer use has expanded the meaning to denote a new paragraph.
