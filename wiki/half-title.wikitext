===Noun===
# The '''half-title''' is a [[page]] that appears before the [[title-page]] in some [[book]]s. It contains the book's [[title]] and might contain some additional decorative elements or [[ornament]]s, but it does not contain the other details given on the title page. The half-title appears on the [[recto]] of a [[leaf]] whose [[verso]] is blank. A [[frontispiece]] (illustration facing the title-page) might appear between the half-title and the title-page.

====Synonyms====
* [[bastard title]]
* [[fly title]]

Note: This terminology is technical and precise, as used in book printing and [[bibliography]]. For example, it makes a clear difference between a page and a leaf. (maybe this should be a category or template <nowiki>{{bibliographic terminology}}</nowiki>?)
