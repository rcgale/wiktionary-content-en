A '''deadline''' is a point in time at which some task must be completed.

==Etymology==

This usage of ''deadline'' comes originally from [[journalism]], representing the time limit for submitting copy to the [[printing|printer]] to be [[typesetting|typeset]].  It probably derives from an earlier usage in printing, representing a guideline marked on a plate for a [[printing press]] (inside which all content should appear).

The early origins of this usage are less certain. The earliest use of ''deadline'' in any sense, as cited by ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]],'' refers simply to lines that do not move such as one used in [[angling]]; slightly later [[American]] usage includes a boundary around a [[prison]] which [[prisoner]]s must not cross. Either of these could have given rise to the printing usage a few decades later.
