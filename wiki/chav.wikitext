===Etymology===
The etymology is disputed:
* ''[[w:The Times|The Times]]'' considers ''[[chav]]'' to have come from nineteenth-century [[Romany]] language, either from [[chavo]], meaning "[[boy]]" or "[[child]]", or from [[chavvy]], meaning "[[mate]]" or "[[friend]]".  This etymology is supported by the existence of other similar words with associations to [[chav]] such as [[charva]] that can be linked to Romany (c.f. [[charver]], the Romany word for "[[prostitute]]").
* Others state is that it is one of several abbreviations (which critics of these etymologies hold to be merely [[backronym]]s and thus false etymologies):
** <u>C</u>ouncil-<u>h</u>ouse <u>a</u>nd <u>v</u>iolent
** <u>C</u>ouncil <u>H</u>ouse <u>A</u>ssault & <u>V</u>iolence
** <u>C</u>ouncil <u>H</u>ouse <u>A</u>ssociation <u>V</u>ermin
* Others state that it originates from one of several slang nicknames for people in various towns and cities, although no concrete evidence has yet been put forward attesting the localized use of [[chav]] as such a slang term at any time ''before'' its use became widespread enough that it would have been used to refer to the same people anyway; and because of that some regard these, too, to be either backronyms or pejorative etymologies invented after the fact:
** girls from [[w:Chatham|Chatham]], [[England]] (claimed by a writer in ''[[w:The Independent|The Independent]]'')
** [[average]] people from [[w:Cheltenham|Cheltenham]], [[England]] (<u>Ch</u>eltenham <u>av</u>erage)
** people from [[w:Chaddesden|Chaddesden]], [[England]]
