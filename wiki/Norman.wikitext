==Pronounciation==


==Etymology==
It is certain that the word is derived from the base of the Germanic words for [[north]] and the Germanic base of the words for [[man]]. However, given the frequent movement of Germanic groups especially into and out of Britain in the post-classical world, it is unclear in what tongue it came to be used first. 
In addition, the generally accepted meaning, a person from Normandy or one of the many French speaking invaders to Britain, was used chiefly by [[Anglo-Norman]] and [[Old French]], though it originally referred to any Scandinavian of the time. ''See [[Northman]].''
