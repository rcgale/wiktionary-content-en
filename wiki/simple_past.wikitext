===Noun===
'''simple past'''

The '''simple past''' allows you to describe something happened in the past. It is "simple" because it is formed by inflection of a single word: there is no auxiliary verb such as ''be'' or ''have'' (unlike the [[present perfect]] and [[past perfect]] tenses).

The simple past tense is also called the ''preterite'' (occasionally ''preterit'') tense.  It is also known more simply as just the ''past tense''.

Compare: [[present perfect]], [[past perfect]], [[past participle]], [[past continuous]].
