=== Noun ===

Oriya, the official language of the State of Orissa, on the east coast of India, and one of the 18 languages recognized in the constitution of India. Oriya is a member of the Indic or Indo-Aryan group of languages, specifically Eastern Indic, of the Indo-Iranian language sub-group of the Indo-European language group. 

Brought to India from the northwest during the second millennium B.C., the Indo-Aryan tongues spread throughout the north, gradually displacing the earlier languages of the area. It can be said to be a direct descendent of Sanskrit, as the majority of the Indian languages, and has close relations to Bengali.
