===Quotations===
*'''2002''': Kevin Warwick, professor of cybernetics at Reading University. Warwick is no stranger to publicity. His autobiography, ''I, '''Cyborg''','' which came out last month (Century, Â£16.99), meticulously catalogues his very many newspaper, magazine, radio and TV appearances. With commendable honesty, he also acknowledges the amount of (unfair, obviously) criticism he has received for being greedy for media attention. That isn't the main thrust of the book, though, which is rather an account of why he is turning himself into a '''cyborg''' &mdash; ''London Review of Books,'' 19 Sep 2002.
*'''2003''': On the track of John and Kate is the T-X (Kristanna Loken), a blond female '''cyborg''' so metallically single-minded, and so impervious to blandishment and punishment alike, that, from where I was sitting, she looked to be our best hope of getting a woman into the Oval Office. &mdash; ''New Yorker,'' 14 &amp; 21 July 2003
*'''2003''': The '''cyborg''' subject, with its pacemakers, drug regimes and artificial limbs, is usually also the First World middle to upper-class economic subject with a conscious incentive to preserve life for as long as possible under the best possible conditions. &mdash; ''London Review of Books,'' 3 April 2003
