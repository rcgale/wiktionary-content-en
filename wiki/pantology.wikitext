'''Pantology''' is a systematic view of all branches of human knowledge or a work of universal information.

Pantology is difficult to more clearly define because it is a little addressed subject and so expansive that it seems beyond the stretch of current human development of knowledge.  An exhaustive search on the Internet shows nearly nothing (11/6/2004) about the word "pantology".  Given the limitation of information about how the word "pantology" is used, it is better to define it negatively, or in other words, to say what it is not:

* Pantology is not a [[philosophy]].  The primary distinction between philosophy and pantology is that a pantology presumes itself to be a "work of universal information" and a philosophy does not.  A pantology must simply be a "work of a universal information" while a philosophy is an object that remains subject to philosophical questioning.

* Pantology is not a [[science]] nor can it be.  By definition, science is limited to explanation of the empirical world.  As such, science cannot explain the non-empirical world.  Without exhaustively addressing this subject, science has no hope of developing to the point of inclusion as a pantology.

* Pantology is not a [[religion]].  As "a work of universal information", a pantology may not be adequately extensive to include the entire humanitarian, theological, logical, mystical, and ineffable domains of religion.
