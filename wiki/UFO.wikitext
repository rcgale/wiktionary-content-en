Information on UFO's : 

Unidentified flying objects are known to carry alien objects and species. They may abduct you for experiments. But they mostly abduct us because they think we are stupid and they find it funny.
Ufos are quite ugly and make a low buzzing sound. Their fuel is tomatoe ketchup...
