===Noun===
'''tetanus''' 

# {{pathology}} A serious and often fatal disease arising through infection of an open wound by the [[anaerobic]] [[bacterium]] ''Clostridium tetani'' that is found in soil and the [[intestine]]s and [[faeces]] of animals. The bacteria produce an [[exotoxin]] which causes spasmodic contraction of voluntary muscles, especially those of the neck and jaw. 

# {{physiology}} A state of muscle tension caused by sustained contraction arising from a rapid series of nerve impulses which do not allow the muscle to relax.
