'''Glass onions''' were large [[hand blown] [[glass]] [[bottle]]s used aboard [[sailing ship]]s, to hold [[wine]] or [[brandy]]. 
For increased stability on rough seas, the bottles were fashioned with a wide-bottom shape to 
keep it from toppling. Thus making the bottles look somewhat onion shaped.
