A '''mouthguard''' is the name given to the type of device that fits into the mouth over one or both arches of teeth, which is usually made of [[vacuum-formed]] plastic.

Mouthguards may be used to protect aginst injury during sport or fighting, or may serve a medical purpose such as the [[splints]] used to treat [[temporomandibular joint]] dysfunction. A thin acrylic mouthguard appliance is often used during [[tooth bleaching]].
