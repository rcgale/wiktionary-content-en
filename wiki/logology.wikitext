'''Logology''' is a rarely used term that means the study of words with an emphasis on letter patterns, often as part of recreational wordplay such as [[crossword puzzle]]s, rather than on meaning. The word was popularized, to the extent that it is popular at all, by Dmitri Borgmann, an author of several books on language in the late 1960s.
