A kayak is a type of small human-powered boat. It was originally developed by the indigenous peoples of the Arctic regions of North America and Greenland commonly known as the Eskimo. The word "kayak" originally meant "man's boat". Construction originally was a wooden frame covered by an animal skin such as seal skin. These original kayaks were used to hunt on the open waters of the Arctic Ocean.
