==Finnish==

===Etymology (1)===

From the Uralic genitive suffix ''*-n''.

===Case suffix (1)===
'''-n''' (''omitted before possessive suffixes'')

# used to form the [[genitive]] case.
#: ''tytö<b>n</b> takki'' "girl's coat"
#: ''poikani takki'' "the coat of my son"

===Etymology (2)===

From Fenno-Volgaic accusative suffix ''*-m''.

===Case suffix (2)===
'''-n''' (''omitted before possessive suffixes'')

# used to form the [[accusative]] case.
#: ''näin tytö<b>n</b>'' "I saw a/the girl"
#: ''tapasin poikani eilen'' "I met my son yesterday"

====Note====

The genitive and accusative look identical in Finnish. The [[object]] of an transitive verb may look also like the [[nominative]] but it's still called the accusative in traditional grammars. There's also the partial object, which uses the [[partitive]] case. For the accusative forms of personal pronouns, see [[-t#Finnish|-t]].

===Case suffix (3)===
'''-n''' (''not used with possessive suffixes'')

# Used to form the [[instructive]] case, usually only in the plural.
#:''Pääsin ojan yli kuivi<b>n</b> jaloi<b>n</b>'' "I could cross the ditch with dry feet."

===Etymology===

From the Uralic first person singular suffix ''*-mV'', probably connected with the first person pronoun ''*mV''; see eg. Finnish ''[[minä]]''.

===Personal suffix===

# The first person singular suffix.
#: ''lue<b>n</b>'' "I read/am reading" 
#: ''kadoti<b>n</b>'' "I lost (an item)"
#: ''e<b>n</b> tule'' "I won't come/I'm not coming"
