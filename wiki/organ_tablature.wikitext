Orgab tablature can refer to any of a number of different schemes for noting music for the organ, mostly used prior to 1600 and mainly distinguished from each other as "Italian", "Spanish", etc. However, in some countries (England, France, and Italy, for example), "organ tablature" was written the same way as other sheet music, but as appropriate for the organ: generally, two clef lines for the manuals and one for the organ pedal. Germany and Spain both had distinctly different systems for the notation of organ music which were fully deserving of the name "tablature".

The term also refers to the body of early printed works for the organ; again, the term "organ tablature" is more appropriately applied to the German and Spanish notation systems, and loosely applied when referring to French, Italian, and English manuscripts.
