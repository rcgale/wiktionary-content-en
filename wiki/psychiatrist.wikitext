===Pronunciation===

*IPA: [[WEAE]] /ˌsaɪˈkaɪ.ə.tɹɪst/

===Etymology===

[[psychiatry|psychiatr(y)]] + [[-ist]]

=== Noun ===

#A medical doctor specializing in the treatment of mental diseases and mental disorders.

''Note:'' People often confuse psychiatrists with [[psychologist|psychologists]]. A psychiatrist is first and foremost a physician. As such he is an expert on the underlying physical causes of mental diseases, such as [[psychosis|psychoses]] (which are caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain), which he treats using mostly physiological and chemical means (such as drugs). A psychologist, on the other hand, is a student of the mind. A psychologist may provide counseling and psychotherapy to persons who have psychological problems that are not caused by physiological pathology. Or, a psychologist may advise a company on how to adjust their working environment to keep their employees happy, something that is totally unrelated to a mental disease.
