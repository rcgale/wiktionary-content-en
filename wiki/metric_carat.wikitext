The metric carat was a normalization devised in the late nineteenth century. Precious stones like [[diamond]]s had been measured in Troy carats which weighed about 205 grams. The metric carat simplified this to 200 [[gram]]s. As it became the standard unit in the Netherlands, where most diamonds are cut, it became standard worldwide. 

Neither of these units called carat has anything to do with the unit of purity of [[gold]] and other precious metals which is also called carat. And the metric carat is not included in the [[SI]].
