'''Color charge'''
#In the Standard Model of particle physics, a property possessed by [[quark]]s, anti-quarks, and [[gluon]]s that determine rules for how these particles may interact.  There are three pairs of colors and anti-colors -- named red, green, and blue, and their corresponding anti-colors (e.g., anti-red).  The terminology has nothing to do with visible [[color]].
