'''Kinesitherapist''' is a common litteral translation mistake of the french-speaking word kinesitherapeute.

The correct translation of this word is [[Physiotherapist]].

This mistake is commom because most of the x-therapeute can be translate in x-therapist, like psychotherapeute and [[psychotherapist]]. Some of the automatic software translator apply this incorrect rule.
