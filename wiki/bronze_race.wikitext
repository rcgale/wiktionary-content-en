'''Bronze race''' is a term adopted in 1960s by [[Chicano]] ethnic group [[MEChA]] to refer to the Latinos in the [[United States]] and the people in [[Mexico]] as a unified "race", similar to the black and white races. In this sense it is largely synonymous to the notion of the [[Chicano]] nation. The decision to call it a separate race may have been influenced by the contemporary negative views of "ethic" or "nation" based nationalism and positive views of "race" based nationalism. The notion was first enunciated in the [[Plan Espiritual de Aztlan]] document.

However, the Spanish cognate '''''Raza de Bronce''''' predates [[MEChA]] by half a century or more. See [[Jos� Vasconcelos]] (indigenismo) (Mexico, 1925), ''La Raza C�smica'', and [[Alcides Arguedas]] (Bolivia, 1919) ''La Raza de Bronce''.
