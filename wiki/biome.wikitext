Biomes, also called ecoregions or biotic areas, are major parts of the Earth's biosphere comprised of communities of living things and the soils, bodies of water, and the air they live in. In the study of Ecology, biomes are "classified according to the predominant vegetation and characterized by adaptations of organisms to that particular environment*.

A biome is a whole system of interactions between and among plant and animal species that have adapted to the particular physical conditions like climate (temperature, rainfall, solar exposure, etc.). Seven generally-recognized biomes are tundras, rain forests, temperate forests, deserts, grasslands, chapparals and taiga. There are also other biome classes that are more specialized, such as river basins, mountaintops, coral reefs and ocean fronts. Even metropolitan areas consist of ecological characteristics that can be viewed as a biome.
