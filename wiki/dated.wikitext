'''Dated''' is a contemporary term used to describe things which are from a bygone era, but are no longer in fashion or popular. As opposed to the term [[retro]], which refers to something taken from the past and made popular anew, something that is "dated" is looked upon as negative. The term can also apply to ideas, notions, and traditions. For example, some people consider the idea of only [[virgin]]al [[bride]]s wearing white as a "dated" tradition. 

Naturally, as social trends wax and wane at the drop of a hat, something that is considered "dated" could be considered "retro" just months later.

'''Dated''' can also refer to a thing whose age has been estimated. Such as with the [[C-14 method]].
