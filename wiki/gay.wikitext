==English==
=== Etymology ===
Possibly from Latin ''[[gaudium]]'', "joy".
The word is known to have been adopted through the French ''[[gai]]'' in 12th century. Other Romance languages had a sense of "slack", "not closely fitting", but its etymological importance is not understood.
It is unclear where the word originally came from. Some, such as [[w:Friedrich Christian Diez|Friedrich Christian Diez]], suggested that it comes from Middle High German.
The sense of "homosexual" is said to have come from an Arabic word via French; it is also said to come from the word's older sense of "dissolute".

==== Usage notes ====
*''Gay'' is almost exclusively used today in its ''homosexual'' and related senses, and, latterly, in the sense of ''boring, etc''.  The earlier uses of ''festive'', ''colorful'', ''bright'' can still be found but have fallen out of fashion and are liable to misunderstanding.
*''Gay'' is preferred to ''homosexual'' by many gay people as their own term for themselves, claiming that ''homosexual'' is a medical term and hence too clinical.
<!--*Some object to sense 5 because they feel it encourages a negative perception of homosexuality while others feel that political correctness is hindering the natural progression of the language.-->

=== Noun ===
'''gay''' (''plural:'' '''gays''')

#a [[homosexual]], most often a male homosexual but sometimes applied to female homosexuals, who are also called lesbians

==== Usage note ====
*Many gay people prefer not to be referred to by this noun, feeling that being known as "gays" depersonalises them and reduces them to little more than their sexual orientation.  The terms they prefer use ''gay'' as an adjective only (as in "gay men").

<!--That is your point of view.  Whatever you might believe, the usage note does reflect the feelings of many gay people.  Please note that information in Wiktionary is intended to be non-partisan.  - Paul G, 3 August 2004, 18:30 UTC
However, the use of '''gay''' as a noun seems no different from any other noun applied to people, like '''American''', '''coach''', '''fan''', '''driver'''; no one seriously believes that a person described by these nouns gets reduced to '''only''' that description.
