==== Usage notes ====
*''Gay'' is almost exclusively used today in the sense of ''homosexual'' and the related senses, and, latterly, in the sense of ''boring, etc''.  The earlier uses of ''festive'', ''colorful'', ''bright'' can still be found but many consider them old-fashioned and liable to misunderstanding.
*''Gay'' is preferred to ''homosexual'' by many gay people as their own term for themselves, claiming that ''homosexual'' is a medical term and hence too clinical.

=== Noun ===
'''gay''' (''plural'' '''gays''')

#A homosexual, most often a male homosexual but sometimes applied to female homosexuals, who are also called lesbians

==== Usage note ====
*Many gay people prefer not to be referred to by this noun, feeling that being known as "gays" depersonalises them and reduces them to little more than their sexual orientation.  The terms they prefer use ''gay'' as an adjective only (as in "gay men").

<!--That is your point of view.  Whatever you might believe, the usage note does reflect the feelings of many gay people.  Please note that information in Wiktionary is intended to be non-partisan.  - Paul G, 3 August 2004, 18:30 UTC
However, the use of '''gay''' as a noun seems no different from any other noun applied to people, like '''American''', '''coach''', '''fan''', '''driver'''; no one seriously believes that a person described by these nouns gets reduced to '''only''' that description.
