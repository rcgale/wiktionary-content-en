===Pronunciation===
*[[w:IPA|IPA]]: /geɪ/
*[[w:SAMPA|SAMPA]]: /geI/

=== Etymology ===
Possibly from Latin ''[[gaudium]]'', joy.
'''Word is known to have been adopted through French, ''gai'' in 12th century.''' Other Romance languages had a sense of ‘slack, not closely fitting’, but its etymological importance is not understood.
'''It is unclear where the word originally came from.''' Some such as [[Friedrich Christian Diez]] suggested it comes from Middle High German. But it is very unclear. 
The sense of ''homosexual'' is said to have come from an Arabic word via French.

=== Adjective ===
'''gay''' (''[[comparative]]'' '''gayer''', ''[[superlative]]'' '''gayest''')

#Happy, joyful and lively (associate noun-gaiety)
#Festive, bright, colorful/colourful. (associate noun-gaiety)
#: ''Don we now our gay apparel''
#: ''Pennsylvania Dutch include the plain folk and the gay folk.''
#Homosexual.
#Used by or intended for homosexuals

#Typical of homosexual appearance or behavior/behaviour.
#(''slang'') Boring, unappealing, bad or of low quality.

==== Usage notes ====
*''Gay'' is almost exclusively used today in its ''homosexual'' and related senses, and, latterly, in the sense of ''boring, etc''.  The earlier uses of ''festive'', ''colorful'', ''bright'' can still be found but have fallen out of fashion and are liable to misunderstanding.
*''Gay'' is preferred to ''homosexual'' by many gay people as their own term for themselves, claiming that ''homosexual'' is a medical term and hence too clinical.

=== Noun ===
'''gay''' (''plural'' '''gays''')

#A homosexual, most often a male homosexual but sometimes applied to female homosexuals, who are also called lesbians

==== Usage note ====
*Many gay people prefer not to be referred to by this noun, feeling that being known as "gays" depersonalises them and reduces them to little more than their sexual orientation.  The terms they prefer use ''gay'' as an adjective only (as in "gay men").

<!--That is your point of view.  Whatever you might believe, the usage note does reflect the feelings of many gay people.  Please note that information in Wiktionary is intended to be non-partisan.  - Paul G, 3 August 2004, 18:30 UTC
However, the use of '''gay''' as a noun seems no different from any other noun applied to people, like '''American''', '''coach''', '''fan''', '''driver'''; no one seriously believes that a person described by these nouns gets reduced to '''only''' that description.
