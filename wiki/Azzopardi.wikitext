Azzopardi is a Jewish surname which is quite common in the Maltese Islands.

'Azzopardi' is derived from A Safardi, which means "A Jew coming from Spain". Most of the Azzopardi families in Malta originated in Toledano, Spain. Though Jewish in origin, most Azzopardi families converted to Catholicism in 1492 when the Jews were expelled, while some left Malta. A few of the families that remained are known to have practised Judaism in secret, but these families eventualy converted fully to Catholicism.
