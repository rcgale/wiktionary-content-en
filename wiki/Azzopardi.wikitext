Azzopardi is a Jewish surname which is derived from 'A Safardi', which means "A Jew coming from Spain". The surname is quite common in the Maltese Islands. Most of the Azzopardi families in Malta originated in Toledano, Spain.

Though Jewish in origin, most of the families converted to Catholicism in 1492 when the Jews were expelled from Malta, while those that refused had to leave the Islands. A few of the families that remained are known to have practised Judaism in secret, but these families eventually converted fully to Catholicism.
