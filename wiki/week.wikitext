==Etymology==

From old English "wicu'", from a German *[[wikon]], which probably originally meant something like ''turn'' or ''succession''. Related to a verb *[[wikanan]] (''to bend''). The Dutch noun derives fro a related verb *[[waikwaz]] (''to yield''), via the current Dutch form [[wijken]].

Related words are old German "wohha" (modern German [[Woche]]), old Dutch weke (week), old saxon "wika", old Norse "vika", Gothic "wik&ocirc;" (''turn for temple service'').
