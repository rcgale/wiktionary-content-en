#''(Phonetics): Sound of the kind or quality heard in speech or song in the consonants ''b'', ''v'', ''d'', etc., and in the vowels; sonant, or intonated, utterance; tone; -- distinguished from mere [[breath]] sound as heard in ''f'', ''s'', ''sh'', etc., and also ''whisper''
#:'''Note''': Voice, in this sense, is produced by vibration of the vocal cords in the larynx  which act upon the air, not in the manner of the strings of a stringed instrument, but as a pair of membranous tongues, or reeds, which, being continually forced apart by the outgoing current of breath, and continually brought together again by their own elasticity and muscular tension, break the breath current into a series of puffs, or pulses, sufficiently rapid to cause the sensation of tone. The [[power]], or [[loudness]], of such a tone depends on the force of the separate pulses, and this is determined by the pressure of the expired air, together with the resistance on the part of the vocal cords which is continually overcome. Its [[pitch]] depends on the number of aërial pulses within a given time, that is, on the rapidity of their succession
