==Filipino slang==

['''jo'''-logs] /_____/


=== Alternate Spelling ===
'''jologz''', '''jolog'''  ''(Filipino slang)''

=== Etymology ===
From pinoy discotheque with a French-sounding name '''[[Jaloux]]''', in business operation up to the mid 1990s in Quezon City, Philippines. Underpriviledged creekside slum boys ([[skwaking]]) with an eye to enter the discotheque (prohibitive prices and burly bouncers notwithstanding) seemed incapable of pronouncing 'jaloux' as [ja-'lou] which is how asshole [[co√±o]] boys and girls circa 1994 did pronounce. Undaunted, these poor dirty street-strutting boys in hip-hop rags took to saying "Ja-lux tayo" (trans., "What say we check out Jaloux"). The economically better-off kids make fun of them for letting their ignorance hang out like oversized hip-hop belts dangling from thin underfed waists. "Mga 'jalux', o!" (trans., "There go the 'jalux'"). Over time this slang sound became 'jologs' as we know it today.

NOTE: I invite people who know this slang to check other sources and update this etymology for historical accuracy.
