# In the English-speaking world creationism usually more specifically pertains to the creation beliefs of Judaism, Christianity or Islam.
# The term is further, more narrowly used in this context, with specific reference to a theological controversy concerning the origin of the human species, and other living beings, and especially questioning in what sense if any the creating acts of God are considered a matter of historical fact
# Even more specifically, creationism is the subject of a debate concerning origins and the findings of science, focused on the degree to which the theory of evolution is compatible with religious belief in the Creator.
