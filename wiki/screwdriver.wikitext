==Etymology==
:'''Screwdriver''': From english [[screw]] + english [[driver]]

==Noun==
#A hand tool composed of a metal shaft protruding from and concentrically aligned with a more or less cylindrical handle, with a [[tang]] usually going the length of the handle. The end of the shaft farthest from the handle (i.e. the [[blade]]) is shaped to fit the head of a [[screw]]. The chisel blade screwdriver is the most common, and has a tapered blade with a rectangular cross section. The Phillips head screwdriver has a blade with a [[cruciform]] cross section. The blade is inserted in the screw head and turned to tighten or loosen the screw. The handle may be fluted, tapered, or covered with a soft material for a stronger and more comfortable grip. The shaft between the handle and blade usually has a circular cross section; sections or entire shafts with square or hexagonal cross sections allow the use of a wrench for additional torque.
#A drink made of vodka and orange juice.
