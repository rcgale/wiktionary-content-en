A '''stogie''' is a thin, cheap [[cigar]], named for [[Conestoga Township, Pennsylvania]].

The word may also refer to any type of cigar. 
<br>It is short for "Conestoga," the type of wagon in which American settlers rode west in the 19th century. Evidently the wagon drivers were fond of one particular type of long, thin cigar, which came to be known as a "stogie," a slang term later applied to any cheap cigar.
