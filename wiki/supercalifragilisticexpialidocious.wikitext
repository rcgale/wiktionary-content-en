A memorable nonsense word from the movie [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Poppins ''Mary Poppins''] (Walt Disney Studios, released 1964), and also the title from a song in the movie.
Some claim supercalifragilisticexpialidocious as the longest word in the english language but realy it is not. In case you are wondering the longest word is: pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis which is a lung disease cause by enhailing silca dust.
