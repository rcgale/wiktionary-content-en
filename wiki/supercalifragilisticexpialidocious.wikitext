===Etymology===
A memorable ''ficticious'' word from the movie [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Poppins ''Mary Poppins''] (Walt Disney Studios, released 1964), and also the title from a song in the movie. It is not a real word, as the creator of the word simply created it for purpose of use in the movie. However, here is its definition nonetheless, as it is used in the movie:

===Adjective===
'''supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'''

# [[fantastic]], very [[wonderful]]

===Notes===
*The "actual" longest word in the English language is disputed.  See [[w:Longest word in English|the Wikipedia article on the longest word in the English language]] for more details.
*In 1965 there was a copyright case over the song ("SUPERCALAFAJALISTICKEXPEEALADOJUS" versus "SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS", more properly Life Music Inc. v. Wonderland Music Co., 241 F. Supp. 653 (S.D.N.Y. 1965)) (see for example [[http://www.law.berkeley.edu/journals/btlj/articles/vol8/Beard/html/note.html]]) in which the court ruled that the word had been in use in the general public for some years before the song was written.
