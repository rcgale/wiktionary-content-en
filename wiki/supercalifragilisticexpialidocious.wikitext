===Etymology===
A memorable nonsense word from the movie [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Poppins ''Mary Poppins''] (Walt Disney Studios, released 1964), and also the title from a song in the movie.  In 1967 there was a copyright case over the song ("SUPERCALAFAJALISTICKEXPEEALADOJUS" versus "SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS") (see for example [[http://www.law.berkeley.edu/journals/btlj/articles/vol8/Beard/html/note.html]]) in which the court ruled that the word had been in use in the general public for some years before the either song was written.

===Adjective===
'''supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'''
# [[fantastic]], very [[wonderful]]

===Notes===
Some claim supercalifragilisticexpialidocious is the longest word in the English language but it isn't [[really]]. In case you are wondering the longest word is: [[pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis]].

However, the longest [[real]] word in the English language is [[antidisestablishmentarianism]].
