'''Mineral''' (plural minerals)

#A naturally occurring [[chemical]] [[compound]] containing one or more [[element]]s. [[Rock]]s are formed from one or more minerals. The distinction between rocks and minerals is often vague, and special cases apply:

:Quartz is a mineral composed of [[silicon]] and [[oxygen]]. A piece of quartz is both a rock and a mineral.

:[[Calcium]] [[carbonate]] forms a variety of minerals with widely different properties. One of these is common [[limestone]], which is both rock and mineral.

:[[Granite]] is a rock made primarily of the minerals [[feldspar]] and [[quartz]]. Granite is not a mineral.

:Native elements like [[gold]] and [[silver]] are included in mineralogical references, but are technically not minerals because they are not compounds. The same elements found in combination with another element, however, are minerals. The mineral [[Calaverite]] is gold silver telluride.

:In general, any rock that is composed of two or more distinct minerals is not itself a mineral.
