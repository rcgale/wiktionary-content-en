A '''lusophone''' is someone who speaks the [[Portuguese language]] natively or by adoption. As an adjective, it means "Portuguese-speaking." The word itself is derived from the name of the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] province [[Lusitania]], which covered an area that is today [[Portugal]].

Lusophone countries include [[Portugal]], [[Brazil]], [[Mozambique]], [[Angola]], [[S�o Tom� and Pr�ncipe]], [[Macao]] and others in various parts of the world. The [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] is an international organization consisting of the eight independent countries where Portuguese is an official language.
