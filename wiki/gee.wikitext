====Usage Note====
''Gee'', ''gosh'' and ''golly'' are generally considered somewhat dated or juvenile.  They are often used for ironic effect, with the speaker putting on the persona of a freshly-scrubbed freckle-faced kid from days gone by (e.g. 1950 sitcom children, such as Beaver on ''[[w:Leave it to Beaver|Leave it to Beaver]]).

===Verb=== <!-- I'm assuming that the command is primary and the verb senses are derived -->

#: ''This horse won't gee when I tell him to.''
#: ''You may need to walk up to the front of the pack and physically gee the lead dog.''
