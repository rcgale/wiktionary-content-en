The [[slang]] word '''Pulsen''' (a [[Dutch language]] [[verb]]) refers to violent disposession, looting, destruction of property and environment. It is derived from the name of a moving company Abraham Puls & Sons, employed by the [[Nazi]]-led Dutch police to pillage and empty the homes of the 140,000 [[Jew]]s of the [[Netherlands]] during the [[Holocaust]].
