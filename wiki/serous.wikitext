In [[medicine]], the adjective '''serous''' is used to describe fluid or discharge that is pale yellow and transparent, usually representing something of a benign nature. This contrasts with the term [[sanguine]], which means blood-tinged and usually harmful. 

The word derives from the noun '''serum''', which can be used in many contexts, again generally a medicinal one. In the noun context, it describes the watery portion of many body fluids, including [[blood]] and [[milk]], and also the watery ([[albumin]]-containing) portion of eggs ([[egg white]]s).
