The '''reading copy''' of a [[book]] is usually well-used, may include highlighting or [[marginalia]], and is suitable for reading, but is usually not collectible. This is a term used in the [[used book]] business, to indicate the lack of collectable value, while claiming that the book is in sufficiently good condition for a purchaser whose interest is primarily in actually reading the book. A reading copy is typically less expensive than a collectable copy.
