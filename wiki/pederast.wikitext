===Pronunciation===
*{{IPA|/pεdεrəst/}}
*{{AHD|/pĕd'ə-răst'/}}

===Alternate spellings===
*[[paederast]]

===Noun===
'''pederast''' (''plural: pederasts'')
# A man who is engaged in an erotic relationship with an [[adolescent]] boy; a practitioner of [[pederasty]].

====Usage notes====
*The term ''pederast'' has sometimes been incorrectly used to describe child rapists and men sexually involved with pre-pubescent children.
*Although "paederast" is an alternative spelling, both spellings are etymogically correct as UK English spellings; the spelling with the "ae" is actually an alternative of the ped- spelling, not the other way around, and neither has anything to do with American English or the spelling reform movements.
