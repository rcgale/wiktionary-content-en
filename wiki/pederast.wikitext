==Pronunciation==
*[[IPA]] pεdεrəst

==Noun==
'''pederast, paederast'''
# A man who has sexual relations with a boy.
Note - although paederast is an alternative spelling, both spellings are etymogically correct as UK English spellings, the spelling with the A E is actually an alternative of the ped- spelling, not the other way around, and neither has anything to do with American English or the spelling reform movements.
