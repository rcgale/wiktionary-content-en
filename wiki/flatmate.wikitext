===Noun===
'''flatmate'''
#A [[person]] with whom one shares a [[flat]].
#A [[person]] with whom one shares a rental property, not necessarily a flat. <!-- In my own experience of Australian usage, people often use the term flatmate to refer to fellow tennants in a rental property, even where that property is a house rather than an apartment, rather than using the term housemate to describe this. -->
