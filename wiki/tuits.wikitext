A '''round tuit''' is an imaginary object whose name is derived by [[word play]] from the phrase "when I get around to it".  The [[phrasal verb]] "to get around to" means to attend to (a task) after finishing one or more others, often with the implication that one has been avoiding the final task for some time because of [[laziness]] or disinclination.

Sometimes the letters "TUIT" or "ROUND TUIT" on a round button or piece of paper are used to show that the person actually has got a "round tuit".  Giving one of these objects to a person implies that he or she is a [[procrastination|procrastinator]].
