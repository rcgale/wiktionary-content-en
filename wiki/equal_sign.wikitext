<!--NOTE: "equal sign" is not a computing term.  In computing, = represents either the assignment operator or the equality operator, depending on the language.  It is never properly called "the equal(s) sign".
Note also that other USES of this symbol do not provide other SENSES of the term, as the symbol remains the same one.-->
