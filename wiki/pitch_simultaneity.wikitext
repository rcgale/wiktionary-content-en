#A '''[[pitch simultaneity]]''' is more than one [[pitch]] or [[pitch class]] all of which occur at the same time. Simultaneity may be thought of as a more general term for any possible [[chord]]. Any [[chord progression]] or harmonic progression is then a [[simultaneity succession]], though not all simultaneity [[succession]]s are harmonic progressions and not all simultaneities are chords.
