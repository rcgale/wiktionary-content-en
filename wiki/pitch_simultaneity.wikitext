===Noun===
#A '''[[pitch simultaneity]]''' is any two or more [[pitch]]es or [[pitch class]]es all of which occur simultaneously, or at the same time. May be thought of as a more general term for any possible [[chord]]. Any [[chord progression]] or harmonic progression is then a [[simultaneity succession]], though not all simultaneity [[succession]]s are harmonic progressions and not all simultaneities are chords.
