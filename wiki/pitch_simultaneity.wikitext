A '''[[pitch simultaneity]]''' is also more than one pitch or pitch class all of which occur at the same time. Simultaneity may be thought of as a more general term for any possible chord. Any chord progression or harmonic progression is then a simultaneity succession, though not all simultaneity successions are harmonic progressions and not all simultaneities are chords.
