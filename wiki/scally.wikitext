Scally: a term which is related to the similar terms chav, chava, townie, pikey, etc. Refers to any member of a rapidly expanding underclass of lowlifes, typically wearing sports brands (especially burberry, fred perry, von dutch etc) and being by nature antisocial, belligerent and with a strong sense of mob mentality, ie travelling in groups and engaging in confrontations this way rather than individually. Comparable to an epidemic of some parasitic virus. Can be found in town/city centres wasting their already pointless lives by sitting on park benches in groups drinking cheap cider and shouting puerile and unintelligent obscenities (eg "Goff!") at passers by who are in any way dissimilar to themselves. Scallies are universally hated by everybody except their own kind, and even then they tend to feud among themselves over women (or the equivalent scally approximation, ie ugly scowling gorgons with tight ponytails, huge earrings and an orange tan), plastic jewellery, fake clothing, and so on.
