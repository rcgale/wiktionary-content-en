A '''grain of salt''' is a literal translation of an ancient [[Latin]] phrase, '''''cum grano salis'''''.

A sort of [[proverb]], the Latin expression indicated that in everything we should use at least a grain of the [[salt]] with which the head was, in Roman times, presumed to be filled.  It was, then, a recall to common sense, a request for prudence or reflection before action.

'''To take''' something '''with a grain of salt''' now means to accept it less than fully.  The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] dates this usage back to 1647.
