'''Irish twins''' is a [[United States|American]] [[slang]] term that refers to siblings born 9 to 12 months apart - usually in the same calendar year, or who are in the same grade in school. The term is considered derogatory by some because it references the large families of [[Irish Catholic]]s who did not use birth control (and thus had many children in quick succession) but is often used endearingly by the families of the "twins" themselves. 

Similarly, '''Irish triplets''' means three children in three years.
