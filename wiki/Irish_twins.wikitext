'''Irish twins''' is a [[United States|American]] [[slang]] term that refers to siblings born 10 to 12 months apart (in the same calendar year). It is considered derogatory because it references the supposedly large families of [[Irish|Ireland]] [[Catholic]]s who did not use birth control thus had many children in succession. A related term is '''Irish twins''' which means three children in three years.
