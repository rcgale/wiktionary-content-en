'''Irish twins''' is a [[United States|American]] [[slang]] term that refers to siblings born 9 to 12 months apart (usually in the same calendar year, or who are in the same grade in school). It is considered derogatory because it references the supposedly large families of [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Catholic]]s who did not use birth control thus had many children in succession. Similarly '''Irish triplets''' means three children in three years.
