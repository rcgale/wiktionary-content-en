#*: ''to walk under the same umbrella''

=== Usage note ===

'''相合傘''' has a strong romantic implication, which stems from the fact that it is a play on words.  The first two characters are pronounced [[あい]], which is homonymic of the word [[愛]] ([[あい]], [[ai]]), which means [[love]], and thus the connotation is that both people under the umbrella are in love.
