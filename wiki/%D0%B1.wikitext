# б is the short form of [[бы]], a verbal particle used to render [[conditional]] and [[subjunctive]] patterns:
#:: [[Я]] [[говорить|говорил]] — ''I spoke''
#: [[Я]] б [[говорить|говорил]] — ''I would (should) have spoken; I would speak; I might speak'' 
#: [[Я]] [[говорить|говорил]] [[бы]] — ''I would (should) have spoken; I would speak; I might speak''
