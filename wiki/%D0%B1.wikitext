'''б''', '''[[бы]]''' (b, by)

# б is the short form of [[бы]], a verbal particle used to render [[conditional]] and [[subjunctive]] patterns:
#:: [[Я]] [[говорить|говорил]] — ''I spoke''
#: [[Я]] б [[говорить|говорил]] — ''I would (should) have spoken; I would speak; I might speak'' 
#: [[Я]] [[говорить|говорил]] [[бы]] — ''I would (should) have spoken; I would speak; I might speak'' 

'''N.B.''' — [[бы]] is the [[third-person singular]] [[aorist]] of [[быть]] ''(to be)'', an otherwise obsolete Russian tense.
