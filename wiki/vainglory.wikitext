===Noun===
'''vainglory'''
# Excessive [[vanity]].

Vainglory is defined by Webster's 1913 Dictionary as excessive vanity excited by one's own performances; empty pride; undue elation of mind; vain show; boastfulness.

Originally included in the 4th century Egyptian monk Evagrius Ponticus eight deadly "passions"; however, Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century enumerated only seven deadly sins, by merging pride with vainglory.
