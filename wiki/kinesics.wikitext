Non-verbal behaviour related to movement, either of any part of the body or the body as a whole.  This was a term used by Ray Birdwhistell, a ballet dancer turned [[anthropology|anthropologist]] who wished to study how different people communicate through posture, gesture, stance, and movement.  Part of Birdwhistell's work involved making film of people in social situations and analyzing them to show different levels of communication not clearly seen otherwise.  The study was joined by several anthropologists, including among others [[Margaret Meade]] and [[Gregory Bateson]].

Ine one current application, kinesics are used as signs of deception by interviewers.  Interviewers look for clusters of movements to determine the veracity of the statement being uttered.
