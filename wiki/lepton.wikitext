#A [[fermion]] that has 1/2 spin and is immune to the [[strong nuclear]] force.  Most are extremely light particles, but the [[tauon]] is a notable exception being twice as heavy as a [[proton]].  All leptons have a [[negative]]ly charged [[particle]] and a [[positive]]ly charged antiparticle, as well as a related [[neutrino]] and antineutrino of [[neutral]] charge.  Members are the [[electron]], the [[muon]] and the [[tauon]].
