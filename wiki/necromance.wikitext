Used in online forums, the term necromance refers to the act of a person (usually a n00b) posting to a thread that is "dead."  This is usually applied to threads that are older than 30 days or so, though, depending on the forum and the traffic in it, the term may be applied to threads as young as a week and a half to two weeks.
