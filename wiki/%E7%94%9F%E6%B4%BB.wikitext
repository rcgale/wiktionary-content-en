=== Noun ===
'''[[生]][[活]]''' ([[せいかつ]], [[seikatsu]])

# [[Life]]; [[livelihood]]; [[daily]] living.

==== Usage note ====
[[生活]] is distinct from [[命]] ([[いのち]], [[inochi]], ''life''), because it refers to daily life and livelihood as it is experienced, rather than life as an abstract concept.  命, in contrast, refers to life as a whole (from birth to death), or as an abstract concept.
