== Japanese ==
=== Noun ===
'''[[生]][[活]]''' ([[せいかつ]], [[seikatsu]])

# [[Life]]; [[livelihood]]; [[daily]] living.

==== Usage note ====
[[生活]] is distinct from [[命]] ([[いのち]], ''[[inochi]]'', ''[[life]]''), because it refers to daily life and livelihood as it is experienced, whereas 命 refers to life as a whole (from birth to death), or as an abstract concept.  Both are generally translated as ''life'', however, as this distinction is not normally made in English.
