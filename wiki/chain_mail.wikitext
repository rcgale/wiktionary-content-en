'''chain mail'''
#(''Armor'') [[Category:Armor]] A flexible [[fabric]] made of interlinked [[metal]] rings interlinked, used as [[defensive]] [[armor]]. The use of "[[mail]]" alone is generally considered the more correct [[term]] in current [[scholarly]] usage.
#:'''Quotations'''
#:*'''1786''':  [[Chain mail]] is formed by a number of iron [[ring]]s, each ring having four others inserted into it, the whole [[exhibit]]ing a kind of [[net]] work, with [[circular]] [[mesh]]es, every ring separately [[rivet]]ted; this kind of mail answers to that worn on the ancient breast plates, whence they were [[denominated]] [[loricæ]] [[hammatæ]], from the rings being hooked together. &mdash; Francis Grose, ''A Treatise on Ancient Armour and Weapons'', page 11.
