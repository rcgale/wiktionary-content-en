#:'''Quotations'''
#:*'''1786''':  Chain mail is formed by a number of iron rings, each ring having four others inserted into it, the whole exhibiting a kind of net work, with circular meshes, every ring separately rivetted; this kind of mail answers to that worn on the ancient breast plates, whence they were denominated [[loricæ]] [[hammatæ]], from the rings being hooked together. &mdash; Francis Grose, ''A Treatise on Ancient Armour and Weapons'', page 11.
