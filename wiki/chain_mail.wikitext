#:'''Quotations'''
#:*'''1786''':  [[Chain mail]] is formed by a number of iron [[ring]]s, each ring having four others inserted into it, the whole [[exhibit]]ing a kind of [[net]] work, with [[circular]] [[mesh]]es, every ring separately [[rivet]]ted; this kind of mail answers to that worn on the ancient breast plates, whence they were [[denominated]] [[loricæ]] [[hammatæ]], from the rings being hooked together. &mdash; Francis Grose, ''A Treatise on Ancient Armour and Weapons'', page 11.
