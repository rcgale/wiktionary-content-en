Fictional inoffensive slang insult invented for the BBC Television series "[[w:Red Dwarf|Red Dwarf]]".
The character Kryten had trouble calling his superior, Arnold Rimmer, by this insult, resulting in his strangled calls of "Smee-Hee". (See also, [[w:Smeg|Smeg]].)  Also, it's a derogatory term targeted towards uncircumcised males and is used commonly in male locker rooms, especially in U.S. high schools.  It's a way for circumcised males put down uncircumcised males.
