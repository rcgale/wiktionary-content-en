=== Etymology ===
The etymology is uncertain.  Some sources hypothesize that the place name is derived from from {{OE.}} [[Hæstingas]] ''Hæsta's people'', the ''settlement of the family/followers of Hæsta'', after the settlement of the eponymous area in England by the Danes; and that the family name is either derived from the place name, simply meaning one who came from Hastings, or derived in parallel from [[Hæstingas]], simply meaning a descendant of one of Hæsta's people. Others state that the family name is from {{G.}}, meaning ''swift one''.

Whichever is the case for the place name in England, most of the later place names in other countries are derived either from the Hastings family name, being named either after people with that family name, or are derived from the earlier place name, being named after the town of Hastings in England directly.
