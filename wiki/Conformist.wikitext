In [[English history]], '''Conformists''' were those whose religious practices were in concert with the [[Established Church]], the [[Church of England]], as opposed to those of [[Nonconformists]] whose practices were not acceptable to the Church of England.

In a more general (small "c" sense), ''conformists'' are those who attempt to comply with all societal norms, generally so as to not stand out in any way and hence be subject to potential ridicule or other social sanction.
