#:*'''1882''': ...1 Hen. V, cap. 10... This statute also denounces the London falt, which contained nine bushels, and a practice which had grown up in the city of making sellers of corn not only submit to this extra measure, but to a tax for measuring corn. &mdash; James Edwin Thorold Rogers, ''A History of Agriculture and Prices in England'', Volume 4, p. 205.
