#:*'''1882''': ...11 Hen. VI, cap. 8... This statute also denounces the London falt, which contained nine bushels, and a practice which had grown up in the city of making sellers of corn not only submit to this extra measure, but to a tax for measuring corn. &mdash; James Edwin Thorold Rogers, ''A History of Agriculture and Prices in England'', p. 205.
