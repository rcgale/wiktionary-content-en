===Usage note===
It is possible that a confusion between different meanings of ''respect'' affects the attitudes of people and organisations. For example, [[freedom of religion]] implies that we are obliged to have regard for the right of anyone to believe whatever they wish, to act in accordance with their beliefs (so long as they respect the [[law]] &mdash; human sacrifice is not an acceptable act), and not to be discriminated against on account of their beliefs. However, the use of the word ''respect'' seems to have shifted our attitudes towards the notion that we must behave respectfully towards their beliefs, and not criticise them. This is a restriction on [[freedom of speech]], and is inherently hypocritical &mdash; anyone with any view on religion must necessarily believe that those who believe differently are deluded, although their rights must be respected.
