Badass is a term that should be used to describe when something is ironically very cool. However it should be noted that if someone refers to themselves as a badass and is wearing a bandana then they are most likely an idiot. Badass is most oftenly used when something is so stupid it becomes humorous and therefore cool. It is also often used to describe a geeky event that is cool. It should be pronounced 'B'dass', and sort of spat out.
