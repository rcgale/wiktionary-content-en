Originally named after Spion Kop, a hill in South Africa, that was the scene of a fierce battle in the Boer war. "The Kop" was a large terraced standing area that was the most popular end of the football ground Anfield, home of Liverpool Football Club. It had a claim to be the largest (23,000 standing supporters) and amongst the noisiest of terraces in British football.
