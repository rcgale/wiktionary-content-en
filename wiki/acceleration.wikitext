#(''uncountable'') The act of accelerating, or the state of being accelerated; increase of motion or action; as opposed to [[retardation]] or [[deceleration]].
#:''a falling body moves toward the earth with an '''acceleration''' of velocity''
#(''countable'') The amount by which a [[speed]] or [[velocity]] decreases (and so a [[scalar quantity]] or a [[vector quantity]]).
#:''The boosters produce an acceleration of 20 metres per second per second.''
#:'''Quotations'''
