===Etymology===
Latin ''[[acceleratio]]'': compare French ''[[accélération]]''
===Noun===
#The act of accelerating, or the state of being accelerated; increase of motion or action; as, a falling body moves toward the earth with an '''acceleration''' of velocity; -- opposed to [[retardation]] or [[deceleration]]
#:'''Notes''' Acceleration in [[SI]] units is measured in [[metres]] per second per second (m/s<sup>2</sup>), or in English units in feet per second per second (ft/s<sup>2</sup>)
#:'''Quotations'''
#:*A period of social improvement, or of intellectual advancement, contains within itself a principle of '''acceleration''' - [[I. Taylor]]
