===Noun===
'''acceleration''' (''[[countable]] and [[uncountable]]''; ''plural'' '''accelerations''')

#(''uncountable'') The act of accelerating, or the state of being accelerated; increase of motion or action; as opposed to [[retardation]] or [[deceleration]].
#:''a falling body moves toward the earth with an '''acceleration''' of velocity''
#(''countable'') The amount by which a [[speed]] or [[velocity]] decreases (and so a [[scalar quantity]] or a [[vector quantity]]).
#:''The boosters produce an acceleration of 20 metres per second per second.''
#:'''Quotations'''
#::A period of social improvement, or of intellectual advancement, contains within itself a principle of '''acceleration''' &mdash; I. Taylor
#(''physics'') The change of [[speed]] with respect to [[time]].

====Usage note====
Acceleration in [[SI]] units is measured in [[metre]]s per second per second (m/s<sup>2</sup>), or in [[imperial]] units in feet per second per second (ft/s<sup>2</sup>).
