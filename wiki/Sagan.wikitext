[[Image:Sagan.jpg|thumb|150px|right| A respected astronomer and dogged critic of pseudoscience, Carl Sagan is best known for his enthusiastic efforts at popularizing science, and famous for saying ''billions and billions of stars...'']]

A '''Sagan''' is a humorous unit of measurement equal to at least 4,000,000,000.

The unit is dervied from the phrase ''billions and billions (of stars)'', repeatedly spoken by the [[United States|American]] [[Astronomy|astronomer]] [[Carl Sagan]] in his quite-distinctive accent. The minimum lower bound of a number conforming to the constraint of ''billions and billions'' must be 2,000,000,000 plus 2,000,000,000 or 4,000,000,000, assuming, of course, that Sagan was using the American English definition for [[billion]].
