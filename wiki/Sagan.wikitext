[[Image:Sagan.jpg|thumb|150px|right|]] A respected astronomer and dogged critic of pseudoscience, Carl Sagan is best known for his enthusiastic efforts at popularizing science.  His PBS television series, ''Cosmos'', along with his regular columns in ''Parade'' magazine, introduced millions to a myriad of science, history, culture, chemistry, physics, evolution, and space exploration. 

Sagan was also known for his predictions of a Nuclear Winter (which lead to the movie ''[[The_Day_After|The Day After]]''), caused by the blocking out of the sun following a nuclear war, due to the amount of particulates in the atmosphere following the burning of many cities.  He fought for nuclear disarmament and against Reagan's "Star Wars" program, which he felt was technically impossible to build and perfect, and destabilizing to Cold War nuclear weapons disarmament progress.

His first and only novel, and subsequent movie, [[Contact]], a story about a scientist who discovers an intelligent signal from outer space, is perhaps his most widely-recognized work.  He was a major supporter of project SETI, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, which continues to collect and process interstellar radio signals in search of evidence of intelligence elsewhere in the universe.  He was also the founder of the Planetary Society, and was a leading planetary scientist.

A '''Sagan''' is a humorous unit of measurement equal to at least 4,000,000,000.

The unit is derived from the phrase ''billions and billions (of stars)'', attributed to the [[United States|American]] [[Astronomy|astronomer]] [[Carl Sagan]]. The minimum lower bound of a number conforming to the constraint of ''billions and billions'' must be 2,000,000,000 plus 2,000,000,000 or 4,000,000,000, assuming, of course, that Sagan was using the American English definition for [[billion]].  Note that though many believe he was famous for saying ''billions and billions of stars...'', he claims he never actually used the phrase (instead, it was Johnny Carson, impersonating Sagan, who popularized the phrase - ref. ''Billions & Billions'',  Carl Sagan, Random House, 1997).
