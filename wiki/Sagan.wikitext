[[Image:Sagan.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A respected [[astronomer]] and dogged critic of [[pseudoscience]], [[Carl Sagan]] is best known for his enthusiastic efforts at [[popular science|popularizing science]] and famous for allegedly saying ''billions and billions of stars...'']]

A '''Sagan''' is a humorous [[unit of measurement]] equal to at least 4,000,000,000.

The unit is derived from the phrase ''billions and billions (of stars)'', attributed to the [[United States|American]] [[Astronomy|astronomer]] [[Carl Sagan]]. The minimum lower bound of a number conforming to the constraint of ''billions and billions'' must be 2,000,000,000 plus 2,000,000,000 or 4,000,000,000, assuming, of course, that we attibute Sagan to using the American English definition for [[billion]].

Note that though many believe Sagan was famous for using the phrase ''billions and billions'', he claims he never actually did, having used instead the simpler phrase ''billions of stars...''. It was actually [[Johnny Carson]], impersonating Sagan, who popularized the phrase attributed to Sagan.
