# {{cattag2|slang|US}} One of many children (specifically uneducated or illegitimate) of [[Negro]] lineage. Often used with the implication or under the assumption that ''all'' those of Negro descent have large amounts of children out of wedlock and do not properly educate those children. Because of its racist connotation, the word is obviously unacceptable amongst forward thinkers and is considered to be extremely offensive.
