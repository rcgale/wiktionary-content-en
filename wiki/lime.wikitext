A '''lime''' is a [[fan fiction]] story that stops short of full, explicit descriptions of sexual activity. A common analogy is that it is PG-13 action, as opposed the NC-17 kind of fanfiction or [[lemon (anime)|lemon]]s, where '''limes''' are not quite as explicit as the lemon. Another definition is that it includes everything up to, but not including penetration, but that can be a subjective call. 

Other forms of '''limes''' are those stories that approach an intimate scene, and then go "off-camera", with the intimacy left to the reader's imagination. As with the other terms of this type, the orientation of the characters involved (such as the slash [[yaoi]] and [[yuri]] pairings) are not as important as the kind of intimate activity engaged in.
