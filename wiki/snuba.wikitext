A combination of [[snorkeling]] and [[scuba diving]] where the swimmer uses the fins, mask, and breathing apparatus commonly used in scuba diving, but the oxygen tanks usually strapped to the back are instead attached to floating rafts that remain on the water's surface.  Snuba diving is a popular activity in tropical tourist locations such as [[Hawaii]] because of its relative ease and the fact that one need not be certified to participate.
