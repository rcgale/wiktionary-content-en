===Noun===
#A [[Christian]] sacrament that involves the partaking of [[wine]] and unleavened [[bread]], which are to varying degrees representative of the body and blood of Christ.  In the [[Catholic]] church, the wine and bread undergo the miracle of [[Transsubstantiation]], by which they become the actual blood and body of Christ.  In [[Protestant]] denominations, it is either seen to contain the spirit of Christ, or it is said to merely represent the body and blood depending on that particular denomination's interperetation.  It is also known as [[Eucharist]], or the Lord's Supper.
#Any form of community activity, such as feasting.
