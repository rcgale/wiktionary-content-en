A '''rhyne''' is a running [[waterway]] that links a [[ditch]] or [[stream]] to a [[river]].

Some sources claim that rhyne is derived from the Irish word ''rathin'', a diminutive of ''rath'' &mdash;a circular mound or entrenchment.  <sup>[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/scrap1/ch04_gn.htm 1]</sup>

Rhynes represent an early method of swamp or marsh drainage.  Large sections of swampland were completely surrounded by trenches deep enough to drain the water from the encircled mound and leave the land relatively dry.  Regular clearing and dredging is necessary to keep the rhynes clear of debris so that they flow freely.
Rhynes have been used extensively in the United Kingdom, especially on marshy coastal areas such as [[Weston-super-Mare]], and many of them are still in use today.  The rhynes near [[Wembdon]] village have some early references, including Fichet's rhyne in [[1579]] and the Great or Wildmarsh rhyne in [[1705]] <sup>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=18709 2]</sup>.
