====Notes====
*In general use, this word is usually used as an [[uncountable noun]].  While this is considered incorrect by some, it is very common, to the extent that using it as a plural noun sounds pedantic, archaic or incorrect.
*In statistics, this word is usually a plural noun, with singular [[datum]].
<!-- there is a strong move to hypercorrect this usage based on misapplied interpretation of the word's Latin origin. Correctors claim it's being misused as a singular noun though they are apparently oblivious to the fact that English has a concept of uncountable nouns. Few people would use the plural '''datas''' and both '''datum''' and '''several data''' sound pedantic, archaic, or wrong to some people.-->
