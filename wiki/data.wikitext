====Notes====
Most people use this word in an uncountable sense yet there is a strong move to hypercorrect this usage based on misapplied interpretation of the word's Latin origin. Correctors claim it's being misused as a singular noun though they are apparently oblivious to the fact that English has a concept of uncountable nouns. Few people would use the plural '''datas''' and both '''datum''' and '''several data''' sound pedantic, archaic, or wrong to most people.
