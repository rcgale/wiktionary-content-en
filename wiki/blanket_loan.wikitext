Also known as a blanket mortgage. A blanket loan is a mortgage lient securing several parcels of property, frequently used by developers who have purchased a single tract of land intending to subdivide into individual parcels. The developer normal requires a "partial release" clause so that individual parcels can be released from the blanket mortgage as they are sold.
