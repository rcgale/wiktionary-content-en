===Etymology===
From Greek '''[[acro-]]''', ''sharp'' or ''high'', + '''[[nym]]''', ''name''

===Noun===
'''acronym''', plural '''[[acronym|acronyms]]'''

#A [[word]] formed from the initial [[letter]] or letters of several other words, and which is itself pronounced as a word.
#Any abbreviation formed from the initial letters of several words, whether the abbreviation is pronounced as a word or not. (See '''Usage Notes''' below.)

===Examples===
*[[RAM]]
*[[EFTA]]
*[[scuba]]

===Usage notes===
#The term ''acronym'' is often applied to any term formed in this way, even if the result is pronouced letter by letter instead of as a word (e.g., [[TNT]], [[BBC]]). Use of this sense may be considered incorrect by those who make the distinction, but use of the less-common term [[initialism]] to describe these abbreviations may be confusing to those who are not familiar with the term.
#Acronyms are generally written with all letters in upper case.  Some acronyms are treated as words in their own right and are written in lower case (such as [[scuba]]).
#Older usage required that each letter be followed by a [[point]] (a period or full stop).  Current usage tends to omit points.
