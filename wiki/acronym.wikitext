==English==
===Etymology===
From Greek '''[[acro-]]''', ''sharp'' or ''high'', + '''[[nym]]''', ''name''

===Noun===
'''acronym''', plural '''[[acronym|acronyms]]'''

#An abbreviation formed from the initial [[letter]] or letters of several [[words]].
#An abbreviation formed from the initial letter or letters of several words, and which is itself pronounced as a word.

===Examples===
*[[RAM]]
*[[EFTA]]
*[[scuba]]
*[[BBC]]
*[[TNT]]
*[[IBM]]

===Usage notes===
#Although contradictory, both meanings of the word ''acronym'' are in common use. The first sense is often criticized by commentators who prefer the term [[initialism]] for abbreviations that are pronounced as the names of the separate letters. 
#Acronyms are generally written with all letters in upper case.  Some acronyms are treated as words in their own right and are written in lower case (such as [[scuba]]).
#Older usage required that each letter be followed by a [[point]] (a period or full stop).  Current usage tends to omit points.
