===Noun===
'''acronym'''

# A [[word]] formed from the initial [[letter]] or letters of several other words, and which is itself pronounced as a word.

===Examples===
*[[RAM]]
*[[EFTA]]
*[[SCUBA]]

===Usage Note===

The term ''acronym'' is often applied to any term formed in this way, even if the result is pronouced letter by letter instead of as a word (e.g., [[TNT]], [[BBC]]).  Strictly speaking, though, these are [[initialism]]s.

Acronyms are generally written with all letters in upper case.
