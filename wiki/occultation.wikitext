The process whereby one celestial object is hidden by another celestial object that passes between it and the observer. Compared to astronomical [[transit]]s and [eclipse]]s, an occultation is said to occur when the nearer object appears larger and completely hides the more distant object. Each of these terms refer to the visible effects of a [[syzygy]].
