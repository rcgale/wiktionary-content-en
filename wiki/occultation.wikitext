'''occultation'''
# An [[astronomical]] [[event]] that occurs when one [[celestial]] [[object]] is [[hidden]] by another celestial object that passes between it and the [[observer]]. Compared to astronomical [[transit]]s and [[eclipse]]s, an occultation is said to occur when the nearer object appears larger and completely hides the more distant object. Each of these terms refer to the visible effects of a [[syzygy]].
