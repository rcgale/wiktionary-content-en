The process in which stenographic notes that are written on a stenotype machine are compared to an electronic dictionary and translated into English (or other language) and simultaneously appear on a computer display as the words are written on the stenotype machine.  Also called "realtime translation."

"Realtime" can also refer to the words that are displayed on the computer screen, produced by the process of realtime.

The stenographic notes written on the stenotype machine are usually written (not called "typing") by a court reporter, transcriptionist, persons in similar professions.  In the case of a captionist, the translated text is displayed on a television screen and is called "closed captioning."
