The process by which stenographic notes that are written on a stenotype machine are compared to an electronic dictionary and translated into English (or other language) and simultaneously appear on a computer display as the words are written on the stenotype machine.  This stenographic notes written on the stenotype machine are usually written (not called "typing") by a court reporter, transcriptionist, persons in similar professions.  In the case of a captionist, the translated text is displayed on a television screen and is called "closed captioning."
