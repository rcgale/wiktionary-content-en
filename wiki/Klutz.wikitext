A '''klutz''' is person who is clumsy, foolish, inept, or accident-prone.  The term is perhaps derived from the Yiddish &#1511;&#1500;&#64303;&#1509; ''klots'' ('wooden beam') which itself is a derivative of the German ''klotz'', meaning a "block" or "lump".

'''Klutz Press''' is also the name of a publisher of children's activity books [http://klutz.com/] based in [[Palo Alto, California]].
