A grommet is a fastener (small grommets are often called 'eyelets') that can be used to reinforce a hole or to attach 2 or more pieces of fabric.

They can be found in tents, tarps and tennis shoes.

A grommet is often made of steel or plastic.
It is typically not used alone, but in conjunction with a washer.
The washer is placed on the other side of the material, so that the grommet does not pull through and tear the fabric.

Grommets come in many sizes and types.
There are those that require a hole to be prepared, or Self-Piercing Grommets (that actually are sharpened and cut out a hole as they are set in fabric).

Sharpened grommets with washer teeth were patented by [[http://www.fasnap.com Fasnap Corporation]]
