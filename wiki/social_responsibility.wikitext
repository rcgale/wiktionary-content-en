'''Social responsibility''' can be viewed as a part of the [[wikipedia:social contract]] in that is the responsibility of each [[wikipedia:entity]] whether it is [[wikipedia:state]], [[wikipedia:government]], [[wikipedia:corporation]], [[wikipedia:organisation]] or [[wikipedia:individual]] that they are contributing to society at large, or on a smaller scale. In a way it can be traced back to ideas such as the [golden rule] of treating everyone else as good as you would want to be treated by everyone else. But there is large [wikipedia:inequality] in the means and roles of different enitities to fulfil their responsibility. This would imply the different entities have different responsibilities. E.g. that [[state]]s should ensure the [[wikipedia:democratic rights]] of its citizens, that corporations should respect and encourage the [human rights] of its employees and that citizens abide with the written [[wikipedia:law]]s. But it also can be more than just that. Many [[wikipedia:NGO]]s mean that their role and the responsibility of their members as citizens is to help improve society by taking an proactive stance in their societal role. It can also imply that corporations have an implicit obligation to give back to society. See more under [[wikipedia:corporate social responsibility]].
