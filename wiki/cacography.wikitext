Derived from the Greek ''graphos'' (writing) and prefixed with ''kakos'' (bad). It is believed to have been introduced in the late sixteenth century, with the emergence of printing technologies and standard lexicon, the need for orthographic spelling was mandatory as opposed to the prior method of spelling upon personal preference.

The word is sadly seldom used in todays spoken word.
