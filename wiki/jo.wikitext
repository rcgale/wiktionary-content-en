==Swedish==
===Adverb===
'''jo'''
#[[yes]]; in disagreement with the last speaker.
#:''Du har inte borstat t√§nderna, eller hur? - Jo, (det har jag)''
#:''You haven't brushed your teeth, have you? - Yes, I have''

====Usage note====
''jo'' is used instead of ''ja'' if the answer ''ja'' to a question could be ambigious - for example in the example above a answer ''ja'' could either be interpreted as a agreement with the person asking, or it could be considered as a confirmation that one really did brush the teeth. The word ''jo'' removes the possibility to agree with the speaker.
