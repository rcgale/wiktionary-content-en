In [[chemistry]], a '''moiety''' is a specific segment of a molecule. For example, [[aniline]] has a [[phenyl]] and an [[amino]] moiety. [[Ethidium bromide]] has both of these.

In [[anthropology]], '''moiety''' is a term used to describe each [[descent group]] in a culture which is divided exactly into two descent groups.  [[Caesar]] uses the term moiety in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' after he learns of the death of [[Antony]]:

: ''The breaking of so great a thing should make''
: ''A greater crack.  The round world''
: ''Should have shook lions into civil streets''
: ''And citizens to their dens.  The death of Antony''
: ''Is not a single doom; in the name lay''
: ''A '''moiety''' of the world.''

Caesar's message symbolizes the gravity of Antony's death, as it represented the triumph of [[Rome]]&mdash;and of [[Western Civilization]]&mdash;over [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra]] and [[Egypt]].
