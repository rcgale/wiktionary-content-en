From the biblical name ''[[Onan]]'': In the Book of Genesis, [[Onan]] - a mythological character - was commanded by his father, [[Judah]], to impregnate the widow, [[Tamar]], of his slain brother, [[Er]], and to raise the offspring of the union. In order to avoid raising descendants for his late brother, however, [[Onan]], ''when he went in unto his brother's wife'', ''spilled on the ground'' (King James Bible). (Does anyone know how ''Onanism'' came to mean masturbation?)
