===Etymology===
From the biblical name ''[[Onan]]'': In the Book of Genesis, [[Onan]] - a mythological character - was commanded by his father, [[Judah]], to impregnate the widow, [[Tamar]], of his slain brother, [[Er]], and to raise the offspring of the union. In order to avoid raising descendants for his late brother, however, [[Onan]], ''spilled his semen on the ground whenever he went in to his brother's wife, so that he would not give offspring to his brother. (Genesis 38:9).  Thus the word ''Onanism'' was coined, meaning ejaculating outside the vagina, or masturbation (because this also spills semen, rather than using it for procreation).

===Noun===
