===Usage Note===
Using this spelling of ''dog'' emphasizes dialect and should only be done if this is explicitly intended.  Every example above could also be written with ''dog'', de-emphasizing dialect.

The particular use of ''dog'' as a form of address or interjection may derive from [[w:African American Vernacular English|AAVE]].  The diphthongization indicated by the spelling is widespread, particularly in the American South and is not unique to ''dog''.  For example, the University of Arkansas razorbacks are often affectionately referred to as ''Hawgs'' in print.
