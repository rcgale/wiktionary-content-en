The word "encomium" (pronounced en-co'-mi-um, from the Greek)generally means the praise of a person or thing. While keeping this general meaning, "encomium" also names several distinct aspects of rhetoric: 
1. A general category of oratory (nearly synonymous with "epideictic"), 
2. A method within rhetorical pedagogy (one of the "progymnasmata": Encomium), 
3. A figure of speech.  As a figure, "encomium" means praising a person or thing, but occuring on a smaller scale than an entire speech.
