==English==



===Usage note===
As the two terms are pronounced practically identically except in careful speech, either may be used.  Note, however, that ''Duck&reg; tape'' is a registered trade mark.

===Noun===

# A generally gray waterproof tape used for a great many purposes, and possessing nearly mythic status in American culture.  Oddly, it's no longer used for constructing duct-work, as building codes require a special heat-proof tape and the technology of ductwork has moved on.
#: ''Son, it's time you learned to use the family duct tape.''
