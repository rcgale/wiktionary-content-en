'''Head of navigation''' is a term used to describe the farthest point above the mouth of a [[river]] that can be navigated by [[ship]]s. This term can be somewhat subjective on many streams, as this point may vary greatly with the size of the ship being contemplated for navigation.  On others it is quite objective, being caused by a [[waterfall]] or a [[dam]] without navigation [[Canal lock|locks]].
