'''Laundromat'''

#(''US'') A ''laundromat'' is a [[business]] that offers [[coin operated]] [[washing machine]]s, [[dryer]]s, and sometimes [[ironing]] or pressing machines for washing [[clothing]] and household [[cloth]] items.

In the ''US'', a distinction is made between a laundromat, which is a business enterprise, and [[laundry]] facilities provided at [[apartment]] houses and [[mobile home]] parks. The latter are smaller and usually not open to the public.
