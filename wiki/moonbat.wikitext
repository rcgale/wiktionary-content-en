a)One who attempts to simultaneously stick his foot in his mouth while comparing his opponent to Hitler.~ "How dare you oppose nationalized healthcare?! You Nazi!"

b) One who, rejecting rational arguments, relies upon ad hominem attacks focusing on the opponent's education and resemblance to Hitler.~ "You know, Hitler also liked to eat sandwiches!"

c)A person who displays sudden leap from nondisputed facts to a conclusion that would baffle the idiots in the asylum. ~ "Yes, I agree that dogs are frequently housepets, that they are mammals, and that they  bark. But don't you see that they are republican overlords intent on selling us to the wombats?"
