The traditional music of The Bahamas is goombay, which combines the musical traditions from Africa with that of the European colonial influence. Goombay, the Bantu word for "rhythm," also refers to the type of goatskin drum used to produce the rolling rhythm of this type of music.

Rake and scrape bands have been playing goombay music since the time of slavery, when African slaves had few resources to create musical instruments. Typically, rake and scrape bands had a drum fashioned out of a pork barrel and goatskin, a carpenter's saw that was scraped with a metal file, maracas, rhythm sticks and a homemade bass violin (a washtub with a string through it that was tied to a three-foot stick). 

Traditionally, rake and scrape music is used to accompany the Bahamian Quadrille and the Heel and Toe Polka dances -- another example of how African and European influences have blended together. 

Today's rake and scrape bands use saxophones, electric guitars or other instruments in addition to saws and goombay drums. However, they still retain the original rake and scrape style.
