Cerrobend®, made by Cerro Metal Products, is also known as Wood's Metal, bendalloy, or pewtalloy.

It is a [[eutectic]] alloy of bismuth, lead, tin, and cadmium, known for its low melting point of 158ºF.

It is named for its primary use as a filler when bending thin-walled metal tubes.  It also has uses for making custom-shaped apertures for medical radiation treatment, and making metal inlays in wood.
