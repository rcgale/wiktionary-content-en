Coined by biologist Richard Dawkins in his book entitled ''The Selfish Gene,'' a '''meme''' is a component of an idea in the same way that a [[gene]] is a component of virus. Dawkins argues that the theory of evolution applies equally to ideas as to organisims. That is to say that ideas do not succeed or fail based on social or moral merit, but rather their propensity to cause people to reproduce (spread) them. With this description, Dawkins launched the new field of [[memetics]], or the study of memes.
