=== Noun ===
'''お[[茶]]''' ([[おちゃ]], [[ocha]]) ''also written as'' [[御茶]]

# Hot [[tea]].

=== Usage note ===
[[お茶]] generally refers to a cup of hot green tea.  In general, black tea is referred to as [[紅茶]], though it can be implicitly included within the term [[お茶]], which literally just means "tea."

The honorific お in お茶 is normally written in hiragana, though you will see it from time to time in more formal or official writing as [[御]] (as in [[御茶|'''御'''茶]]).  Also, お茶 is one of the unusual cases of the honorific お(御) that can be used to refer to anyone, including the speaker.  See the usage note at [[御]].
