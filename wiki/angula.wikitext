'''''Angula''''' is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for an elver, or baby [[eel]].  (The word for an adult eel is ''anguila''.)  It is 5 centimeters long, thin, white and light grey coloured, and looks like a short spaghetto. 

It is highly appreciated as a gastronomic delight in some regions of northern [[Spain]], and is very expensive. It is possible to prepare Angula with olive oil and laminated [[garlic]]: first warm up the oil, fry the laminated garlic and a few [[cayena]] pieces. After that, fry the angulas for a few seconds, just to warm them up. It is best to cook it in a small earthenware casserole.
