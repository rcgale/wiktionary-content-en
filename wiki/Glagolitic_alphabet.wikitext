<!-- previous encyclopedic def
# An alphabet designed in the 9th Century CE by St. Cyril before he and his brother St. Methodius set out for their journey to Great Moravia. He designed the alphabet from the Greek alphabet, adding to it elements of the Hebrew alphabet to fill in the many sounds that occur in Slavic languages but not in Greek. The alphabet was a work of a genius, very thorough, capturing all nuances (a [[phonetic alphabet]]) which, alas, made it impracticable for common use. After St. Cyril's death his disciples designed a much simpler alphabet which they named in honor of their teacher the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] and which has been in use ever since.
