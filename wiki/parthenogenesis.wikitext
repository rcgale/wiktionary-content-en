===Noun===
'''parthenogenesis'''

#The production of new individuals from [[virgin]] females by means of [[ova]] which have the power of developing without the intervention of the male element; the production, without [[fertilization]], of cells capable of [[germination]]. It is one of the phenomena of alternate generation.  Cf. [[Heterogamy]], and [[Metagenesis]].
#The production of seed without fertilization, believed to occur through the [[nonsexual]] formation of an embryo extraneous to the [[embrionic vesicle]].
#Basis for the Virgin Birth of [[Jesus Christ]]. Since there was no Y-chromosome introduced by a male, Jesus should have been born female (X-X chromosome), and this is seen as evidence of Divine intervention.
