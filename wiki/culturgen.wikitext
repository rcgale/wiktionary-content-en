'''Culturgen''' is a term coined to describe the phenomenon of propagating mutating cultural units that form the subject of memetics.  This term has fallen in popularity, and now the older term [[meme]] (coined by [[Richard Dawkins]] in his book [[The Selfish Gene]]) is used in its stead almost universally.
