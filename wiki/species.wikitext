=== Etymology ===

Latin: ''species'' [[view]]; [[appearance]]; [[vision]]; [[dream]]; [[semblance]] <''specere'' to [[see]] + ''-ies'' suffix signifying [[abstract]] noun

=== Noun ===
'''species''' (Plural: [[species]])

# A group of objects having similar appearance
#: ''This species of rock is unique to the area''
#:''Pigeons and ducks are two species of birds.''
# A well-differentiated form of [[organism]], more distinct than a [[variety]]
#: ''Hence, in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species or a variety, the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and wide experience seems the only guide to follow.'' -- Darwin, '''On the Origin of Species'''
# A well-differentiated [[clade]] whose members are similar
# '''Taxonomy''' The major [[subset]] of a [[genus]].  Organisms are grouped within a species because they have similar [[genotype]]s and [[phenotype]]s, their [[genetic sequence]]s are almost identical, or other evidence such as the [[fossil record]] points to recent common ancestry.  Organisms which [[reproduce]] [[sexually]] are also grouped together if they are capable of producing [[fertile]] [[offspring]] with one another through [[sex]].
#: Note: A specific species is referred to by its genus and species in italics with the genus name capitalized (e.g. The [[cougar]] is in the genus ''Felis'' and the species ''concolor'', so its scientific name is ''Felis concolor'').
