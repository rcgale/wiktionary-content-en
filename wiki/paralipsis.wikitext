[[Noun]]

Paralipsis occurs when a speaker will use manipulative language to pretend to omit something from their speech. An example is where a speaker might say, "I refuse to respond to the brutally cruel charges of my inhumane opponent, nor will I report his brash and unorthodox conduct."

It is sometimes written as [[paralepsis]], [[paralepsy]], or [[paralipsis]].
