#one who is [[left-handed]] ([[informal]])

The term is normally used to describe a left-handed [[boxer]].
The term also applies to left-handed [[write]]rs who instead of mirroring [[right-handed]] writers, turn their hand [[upsidedown]], [[finger]]s and writing implement pointing towards their body in order to put the writing implement in the same position as right-handed writers.
