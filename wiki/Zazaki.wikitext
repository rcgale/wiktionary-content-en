====Please  stop Turkish and Kurdish fascism.====



The '''Zaza''' are an [[ethnic  minority]] in eastern [[Turkey]]. Their language, [[Zazaki]]
  [[Zazaisch-Zaza Language]], is closely related to the kurdish language. For this reason, the Zaza are often referred to as a subgroup of the kurds,which is not correct and heavily opposed by themselves.

----
'''Zaza''' is also a name that appears [http://www.htmlbible.com/kjv30/B13C002.htm#V33] in the [[Bible]], meaning "belonging to all" or "plenty". [http://www.free-definition.com/List-of-Biblical-names.html]
