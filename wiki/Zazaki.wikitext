The Zaza are an ethnic minority in eastern Turkey. Their language ([http://www.zazaki.de Zazaki]) is closely related to the Kurdish language. For this reason the Zaza are often referred to as a subgroup of the Kurds, which is not correct and heavily opposed by themselves. 
Zaza is also a name that appears in the Bible meaning "belonging to all" or "plenty"
