=== Etymology ===
German [[um]] + [[laut]]

=== Noun ===
'''umlaut''' (umlauts)

# A partial [[assimilation]] of a vowel.
# A vowel so assimilated.
# The [[diacritical mark]] ( Â¨ ) placed over a vowel to indicate such assimilation.

====Note====
*Although this symbol has the same form as the [[diaeresis]]/[[dieresis]], it has as a different function and so these two terms are not interchangeable.

=== Verb ===
'''umlaut''' (umlauted, has umlauted)

# To place an "umlaut" over a vowel.

====Note====
*When [[spell]]ing a German word out loud, one can say "(vowel) umlaut" or "umlauted vowel".  e.g. "oh umlaut" or "umlauted oh" mean "an 'o' with an umlaut over it".
