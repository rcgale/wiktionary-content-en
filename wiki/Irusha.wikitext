'''Irusha''' is a common Sri Lankan name that dates back to 2000 B.C.E. The King of Sri Lanka was Irusha Samaratanga, and spent his life's effort in attacking and invading India. He successfully did manage to invade all of Southern India and most of North India and ruled with an iron fist for nearly 100 years. He was beaten back into exhile to Sri Lanka for his treacherous deeds by King Ronak, and he started a terrorist group which still presides over the black market of Sri Lanka today.

'''Irusha''' also means "tomato lover" as in the grower of tomatoes for non-profit use. To be called an Irusha means to be the lover of tomatoes as they utilized the tomato plant in every way possible, much as the Natives of America utilized Buffalo meat. Many Sri Lankans still greet each other with "Salo Hijda Irusha" which roughly translates to "good day, tomato lover"
