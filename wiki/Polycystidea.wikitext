#:'''Editor's note:'''  Taxonomic revisions and the adoption of standardized suffixes for naming biological entities appear to have rendered the name of this "division" obsolete.  The intended organism appears to be a [[parasitic]] [[amoeba]]-like [[protozoan]] in the subclass [[Telosporea]] rather than the flatworm family [[polycystidae]]
