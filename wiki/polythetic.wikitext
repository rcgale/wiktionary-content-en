Polythetic Class  - 
A category or class that is defined in terms of a broad set of criteria that are neither necessary nor sufficient. Each member of the category must possess a certain minimal number of defining characteristics, but none of the features has to be found in each member of the category. 

An example of this is in psychology- the definition of Major Depression is 5 of 9 criteria. One person may have 1-5, person # 2 has 5-9 )only one overlap), yet both meet criteria.
