'''''Verboten''''' is the [[German language|German]] equivalent of '''forbidden''' or '''prohibited'''. Used in an [[English language]] context, its connotations are those of an authoritarian state, be it the German Empire under [[Wilhelm II]] or [[Nazi Germany]], as in both cases, inhabitants were seen as subjects having to obey orders rather than as free citizens. Today, the term is often used half-jokingly.
