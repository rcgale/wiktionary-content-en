=== Noun ===
[[Category:English nouns]]
'''roflcopter''' (also '''ROFLcopter''' and '''ROFLCopter''')
# (''Internet slang'') a helicopter or gyrocopter emblazoned with the word "[[ROFL]]"
#:'''usage note''': Such usage is often figurative, to express an amount of laughter, or laughter to an exaggerated degree, that would be otherwise expressed by an overuse of [[LOL]], [[ROFL]], and their various derivatives.  However, the irony was taken to the point of constructing animated pictures of such helicopters and including them in computer games, and thus sometimes the usage is literal rather than figurative.
