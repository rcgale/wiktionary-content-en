===Usage note===
*'''Continuous''' is the stronger word, and denotes that the continuity or union of parts is absolute and uninterrupted; as, a '''continuous sheet''' of ice; a '''continuous''' flow of water or of argument. So Daniel Webster speaks of "a '''continuous''' and unbroken strain of the martial airs of England." 
*'''Continual''', in most cases, marks a close and unbroken succession of things, rather than absolute continuity. Thus we speak of '''continual''' showers, implying a repetition with occasional interruptions; we speak of a person as liable to '''continual''' calls, or as subject to '''continual''' applications for aid, etc.
