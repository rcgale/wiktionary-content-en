Syn: {Continuous}, {Continual}.

       continuity or union of parts is absolute and
       uninterrupted; as, a continuous sheet of ice; a

       of the martial airs of England.'' Continual, in most
       cases, marks a close and unbroken succession of
       things, rather than absolute continuity. Thus we speak
       of continual showers, implying a repetition with
       occasional interruptions; we speak of a person as
       liable to continual calls, or as subject to continual
       applications for aid, etc. See {Constant
