Phosphine is a simple molecule that consists of a single phosphorous atom and three hydrogen atoms, PH<sub>3</sub>. Phosphine is a gas at standard temperature and pressure and has a densitiy very close to that of air. Phosphine is also highly toxic to organisms undergoing [[oxidative respiration]], but is non toxic to organisms kept under low oxygen (<1%) or that can anaerobically respire (i.e. [[ferment]]).
