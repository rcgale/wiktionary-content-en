Many years ago in an Adelaide horse race there was a horse named for a kind of bird: the Spangled Drongo (Dicrurus bracteatus). Word got out that it was a sure winner and all the smart money went on it. Drongo ran very near last. Much money was lost. So drongo came to mean a useless or disappointing person.
