'''whence'''

# From [[where]].  (''Whence did I come?'')
#:This word is unusual in modern usage; the more common phrase would be ''Where did I come from''.  It is more often encountered in older works, or when used poetically. Note that although the phrase ''from whence'' is frequently seen in older works, it is technically incorrect as the ''from'' is not needed.
