'''whence'''

# From [[where]].

====Usage note====
The use in the sense of "from where" is uncommon in modern usage; the more common phrase would be ''Where did I come from''.  It is more often encountered in older works, or in poetic or literary writing.  Note that although the phrase ''from whence'' is commonly found, it is technically incorrect as the ''from'' is not needed.
