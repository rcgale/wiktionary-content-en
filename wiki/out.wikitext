==== Translations ====
In many languages there is no direct translation, as the idea expressed by the English ''adverb'' is expressed by a ''prefix'' in many languages. German is somewhat half way in-between as it uses a ''prefix'' in the infinitive of its verbs, but often, though not always, separates the prefix into the same form as the English ''adverb'' when cojugating them.

*German: usually expressed by the prefix [[aus-]]
*Latin: usually expressed by the prefix [[ex-]].
*Slovak: usually expressed by the prefix [[vy-]] or sometimes [[z-]]

===Noun===

==== Translations ====
