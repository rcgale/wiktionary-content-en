==== Translations ====
*Irish: [[amach]]

In many languages there is no direct translation, as the idea expressed by the English ''adverb'' is expressed by a ''prefix'' in many languages. German is somewhat half way in-between as it uses a ''prefix'' in the infinitive of its verbs, but often, though not always, separates the prefix into the same form as the English ''adverb'' when cojugating them.

*Dutch: usually expressed by the prefix [[uit-]]
*Esperanto: usually expressed by the prefix [[el-]] and/or preposition [[el]] (1), [[ekstere]] (2)
*German: usually expressed by the prefix [[aus-]]
*Latin: usually expressed by the prefix [[ex-]].
*Slovak: usually expressed by the prefix [[vy-]] or sometimes [[z-]]
