Cultural experience that takes the form not just of a visit to but of a journey through another culture. Culture could be something as limited as a meal on the street with someone in an unfamiliar city or as unbounded as a trek of thousands of miles. 

Term was probably coined in Philip Nikolayev's poem "Transcultural in Calcutta"
in *Dusk Raga* (1998)
