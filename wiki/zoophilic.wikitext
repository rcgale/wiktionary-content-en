'''Zoophilic''' means liking or preferring animals. 

Zoophilic organisms are found primarily in animals and cause marked inflammatory reactions in [[human]]s who have contact with infected [[cat]]s, [[dog]]s, [[cattle]], [[horse]]s, [[bird]]s, or other animals. This is followed by a rapid termination of the infection.
