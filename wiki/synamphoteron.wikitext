== Synamphoteron ==
Synamphoteron comes from the Greek words syn+amphoteron (both together). It is a practical recipe to deal with [[dogmatism]]. Instead of talking endlessly about who is right and who is wrong and spend time, synamphoteron suggests this: "i take that '''you''' are right in theory. But in action i will accept some of your right, only if you accept some of my wrong. it is an eastern bazaar for when the dialogue can not upply. [[Arberor]]
