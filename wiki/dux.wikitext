'''''Dux''''' (plural ''Duces'') is [[Latin]] for "leader". The term is primarily used in a military context.

==History & Nobility==

===Classical Antiquity & Byzantium=== 

In Latin, ''Dux'' was originally a generic name for a military commander, such as a Roman general who commanded one or multiple legions without being a [[governor]]. It was often used, with or without such specification, for a [[dux bellorum]] (literally, "leader of wars", a common description for various, mainly tribal, barbarian leaders) or [[dux provinciae]] (literally, "leader of a province") and the like. 

The term was also used in the "absolute" sense: in both the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] and [[Western Roman Empire]]s, it was the less senior (contrary to the later nobiliary ranks) of the military [[Comes]] (hence Count, but below Duke) among the new military commanders, alongside the provincial governors, to whom was entrusted the permanent care of the border guard, especially in garrisons -on the [[limes]] (systematical fortications) along the Rhine, Danube, tribal deserts and rival Persia- in a specific military resort, usually corresponding to one or more civilian [[Roman province]]s, often sharing names or about. See for example [[Dux Britanniarum]].

The ''duces'' are listed in the authentic early fifth century [[Notitia Dignitatum]], which enumerates their assigned troops as well as their ''[[officium]]'' (staff) circa AD 405;  for a map ('circa 408AD') see [http://www.friesian.com/images/maps/romaniaa.gif The Friesia project]

Here is the list, ordered by major administrative divisions and in each case followed by the Comites (more mobile troops):

* 11 ''Duces'' in the (eastern) Pretorian PREFECTURE of (the EAST =) ORIENS : 
:* Two ''Duces'' in the diocese of AEGYPTUS (EGYPT) : in Libya (two numbered provinces) and in Thebais (province, i.e. Upper Egypt); also 1 Count : Comes Aegypti (in Lower Egypt)
:* Six ''Duces'' in the diocese of ORIENS : Arabia (also?at another time? a Count), Mesopotamia, Osrhoene, Palestina, (Eufratensis &) Syria; also a Count in Isauria
:* One ''Dux'' in the diocese of PONTUS : the Duke of Armenia (2 numbered provinces); no Comes
:* Neither a ''Dux'' nor a count in the equally Anatolian diocese of Asiana
:* Two ''Duces'' in the European diocese of THRACIAE (THRACE) : in Moesia Secunda and in Scythia (each one border province); no Count 

** 2 duces in the (eastern) Pretorian PREFECTURE of ILLYRICUM : 
both these Dukes in the diocese of ILLYRICUM : in Dacia ripensis and in Moesia prima (each one province); no Count 

** (western) Pretorian PREFECTURE of ITALIA (ET AFRICA) : 
*** neither Dux nor Comes in Rome's own diocese of ITALIA SUBURBICARIA;  
*** one Dux in the diocese of ITALIA ANNONARIA : Duke of Raetia (two numbered provinces); no Count 
*** 3 Dukes in the diocese of PANNONIAE : in Pannonia prima &  Noricum ripense, in (ripuarian) Valeria, in ; only later also a Count called of Illyricum (disputed prefecture, see above)
*** 2 Dukes in the diocese of AFRICA : in Mauritania (Caesariensis) and in Tripolitania; also a Count of (all?) Africa

** (western) Pretorian PREFECTURE of GALLIAE : 
*** 5 Dukes in the diocese of GALLIAE (i.e. northern Gaul & Roman Germany) : in Armorica (i.e. Britanny), in Belgica (secunda), in Mogontiacensis, in Sequanica; also a Comes of the Tractus Argentoratensis; (later abolished?) in Germania prima; no Comes
*** neither Dux nor Count in the neighbouring diocese of VIENNENSIS (i.e. southern Gaul) 
*** one Dux in the diocese of BRITANNIAE, called Duke of Britain, in northern England, on Hadrian's wall; also two Counts : one called of Britain and one of the (southern) Saxon shore
*** no Dux in the diocese of HISPANIAE; also a Count of (Mauritania) Tigitana and -shortly later- a Count of (all Iberia=) Spain 

* In the Byzantine empire after the fall of Rome, the title was, according to one (erroneous, generalizing?) Wikipedia-article, made the regular one for the commanding officers -but another says these were styled [[Strategos]], as in Hellenistic times-(military governors in modern terms) of the [[Themes]], new territorial circonscriptions that would gradually replace the provinces as pivotal sub-empire level. cfr. [[Exarch]]

===Aristocracy===
*Dux is also the etymological root of the feudal and modern nobiliary title [[duke]] (generally ranking below [[prince]] but above [[marquess]] and [[count]]), and is often Anglicized as such. 

*The same goes of course for the equivalents in various (mainly romance) languages, including the Italian [[doge]] (of two maritime city states with colonies, Venice or Genua) and [[duce]] (fascist leader Benito Mussolini) which both entered English and other languages in their own right.

*And of course it applies to derived titles : [[Archduke]], [[Grand Duke]] (both higher in rank, though below King)
