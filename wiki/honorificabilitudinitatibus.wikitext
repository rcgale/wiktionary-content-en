===Notes===
This word is an example of a [[hapax legomenon]], occurring in Shakespeare's works only in Act V, Scene I of Shakespeare's ''Love's Labour's Lost'' (and only very rarely in the works of other authors). An anagram of ''hi ludi, F Baconis nati, tuiti orbi'' (Latin for "these plays, F Bacon's offspring, are preserved for the world"), the word is claimed by anti-Stratfordians as evidence that Francis Bacon was in fact the author of Shakespeare's plays.
