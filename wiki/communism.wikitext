Communism is a form of society governed equally by all its members and where all resources are freely available to all with no restriction of ownership. A general definition is that it is a classless, stateless & moneyless society. Communism is the natural state of mankind in which people existed for many thousands of years before competition for resources created the classical society somewhere around 2500 BC. It is only in (relatively) recent history that communism has been wiped out with the European takeover of Australasia. However, a few primitive communist societies still exist in remote regions.

Karl Marx showed that a return to this form of society is the logical next step after capitalism, but communism with the benefits of technology allowing a global, rather than a tribal, society. During the 20th century there were several attempts to initiate a modern communist society. However, it has been demonstrated that communism and capitalism cannot coexist and the attempts were doomed to, at best, state-capitalism. Unfortunately, these attempts have resulted in the term 'communism' now being applied the brutal state-capitalism as practiced in the USSR and Maoist China.
