'''communism'''
#A [[socialist]] society in which resources are held collectively, under the slogan "from each according to his or her ability, and to each according to his or her need", and in which the State is either abolished because it is harmful or withers away because it is no longer required.  Communism is the final aim of revolutionary socialist ideologies such as [[Marxism]] and [[anarchism]].

#The ideology of parties that use the term "Communist" in their name, i.e. Leninists and Stalinists.
