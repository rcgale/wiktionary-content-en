'''codpiece''' (''plural'' codpieces)

#A part of [[male]] [[dress]] in front of the [[breeches]], formerly made very [[conspicuous]].
#:'''Quotations'''
#:*'''1598''': Borachio. Seest [[thou]] not, I say, what a [[deform]]ed thief this [[fashion]] is, how [[giddily]] 'a turns about all the hot-bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty, sometimes fashioning them like [[Pharaoh]]'s soliders in the [[reechy]] [[painting]], sometime like god Bel's [[priest]]s in the old church-window, sometime like the shaven [[Hercules]] in the [[smirch]]'d worm-eaten [[tapestry]], where his [[codpiece]] seems as [[massy]] as his [[club]]? &mdash; William Shakespeare, ''Much Ado about Nothing'', Act III, Scene III, line 130.
#A conspicuous protection for the male [[genital]]s in a suit of [[plate]] [[armor]].
#:'''Quotations'''
#:*'''1786''': On some suits were screwed large iron '''cod-pieces'''; these, according to tradition, were intended to prevent the [[ill]] [[consequence]]s of those violent shocks received in [[charg]]ing, either in [[battle]], or at a [[tournament]].  Same say, they were meant to contain [[spunge]]s for receiving the [[water]] of [[knight]]s, who in the heat of an [[engagement]] might not have any more convenient method of discharging it.  But most probably, they were rather constructed in conformity to a [[reigning]] [[fashion]] in the make of the breeches of those times. &mdash; Francis Grose, ''A Treatise on Ancient Armour and Weapons'', page 21.
