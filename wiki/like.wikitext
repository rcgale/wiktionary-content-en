===Particle===
'''like'''

# (''colloquial, somewhat dated'') A mild intensifier.
 ''Like, why did you do that?''
#:''Usage Note:'' A similar usage (and perhaps the origin is this one), is roughly equivalent to ''saying'', as in
''I was like, "Why did you do that?" and he's like, "I don't know."''
#:This usage is deliberately informal, centered around teenage years, and perhaps peculiar to the U.S.  In recent years, it has been supplanted by ''goes'' and ''all'', as in
''I was all, "Why did you do that?" and he was all, "I don't know."''
#:The proper inflection for this is probably best learned by example.
