# (''[[colloquial]], somewhat dated'') A [[mild]] [[w:intensifier|intensifier]].
 ''Like, why did you do that?''
#:''Usage Note:'' A similar usage (and perhaps the origin is this one), is [[rough]]ly equivalent to ''saying'', as in
 ''I was like, "Why did you do that?" and he's like, "I don't know."''
#:This usage is [[deliberate]]ly [[informal]], centered around [[teenage]] years, and perhaps peculiar to the [[w:U.S.A.|U.S.A]].  In recent years, it has been supplanted by ''goes'' and ''all'', as in
 ''I was all, "Why did you do that?" and he was all, "I don't know."''
#:The proper inflection for this is probably best learned by example.
