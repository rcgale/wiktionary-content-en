#:''Usage Note:'' A similar usage (and perhaps the origin is this one), is roughly equivalent to ''saying'', as in
#:''I was like, "Why did you do that?" and he's like, "I don't know."''
#:This usage is deliberately informal, centered around teenage years, and perhaps peculiar to the U.S.  In recent years, it has been supplanted by ''goes'' and ''all'', as in
#:''I was all, "Why did you do that?" and he was all, "I don't know."''
#:The proper inflection for this is probably best learned by example.
