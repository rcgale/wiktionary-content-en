Honey Dipper (noun): any of various devices, usually wooden but occasionally made from stone or some other material, used to extract honey from a honey pot or jar and drizzle it onto food.  The honey dipper has a long, thin, cylindrical handle with a large, grooved ball on one end.  The grooved ball is dipped into the honey.  A reasonable amount of honey gloms on to the dipper, allowing the user to remove only the honey he/she desires while promoting precise honey dispersal over food and reducing the danger of hand stickyness.

Frankly I think honey dipper is a stupid name for such an elegant, and specific, tool.  In fact, I don't even know if it is the official name or if some other fantastic, and almost certainly painfully French, term exists.  Google certainly came back with plenty of websites with "honey dipper" and no websites with [impossibly spelled word, half of which you don't pronounce].  So, in the absence of any better word, I would like to propose one of my own: pollocker.
