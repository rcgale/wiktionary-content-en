'''Spack''' (also '''spacker''' and '''spacko'''): slang noun, meaning a clumsy, foolish or mentally deficient person. Often used to mock a person's clumsiness, for example "You spilt beer on your shirt, you spack!'" Also '''spack attack''': a sudden outbreak of clumsy behaviour. Especially popular among English schoolchildren during the 1990s. Derived from the use of [[spastic]] as a term of abuse, and often considered taboo because of its origin.
