'''Remand''' is the [[imprisonment]] of [[suspect]]s awaiting trial or [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]]. A [[prisoner]] who is denied or refused [[bail]] is held in a prison on remand.

Reasons for being held in custody on remand may include

*the suspect has been accused of carrying out a particularly serious offence
*the suspect having previous [[conviction|convictions]] for similar offences
*reasons to believe the suspect could disappear before their trial
*reasons to believe the suspect may interfere with [[witnesses]]
*the suspect is likely to commit further offences before their trial
	
In most countries, remand prisoners are considered [[innocent until proven guilty]] by a [[court]] and may be granted additional benefits to those of sentenced prisoners such as 

*wearing own clothes rather than prison uniform
*voting in [[elections]]
*may not have to work or attend [[prison education|education]]
*may be entitled to additional visiting hours per week

Remand prisoners are usually detained separately from sentenced prisoners, however, due to prison overcrowding they are often held in a shared accomodation with sentenced prisoners.

Remand can cause hardship and a punishment for a suspect, even though he or she has not yet been sentenced.
