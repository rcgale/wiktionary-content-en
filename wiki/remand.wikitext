'''Remand''' is the [[imprisonment]] of [[suspect]]s awaiting trial or [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]]. A [[prisoner]] who is denied or refused [[bail]], or who is unable to post bail, may be held in a prison on remand.

Reasons for being held in custody on remand vary depending on the local legal system, but may include

*the suspect has been accused of carrying out a particularly serious offence
*the suspect having previous [[conviction|convictions]] for similar offences
*reasons to believe the suspect could leave the court's jurisdiction to avoid its trial and possible punishment
*reasons to believe the suspect may interfere with [[witness]]es
*the suspect is likely to commit further offences before their trial
*the suspect is believed to be in danger from accomplices, victims, or vigilantes
	
In most countries, remand prisoners are considered [[innocent until proven guilty]] by a [[court]] and may be granted greater privileges than sentenced prisoners, such as 

*wearing own clothes rather than prison uniform
*voting in [[election]]s
*may be entitled to additional visiting hours per week

Remand prisoners are usually detained separately from sentenced prisoners, however, due to prison overcrowding they are sometimes held in a shared accomodation with sentenced prisoners.

Remand can cause hardship and a punishment for a suspect, even though not yet convicted of any crimes or sentenced.

==Criticism==

In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], more than half of persons currently being incarcerated are remand prisoners, generally those awaiting trial.  Most face modest demands for [[bail]] that they simply don't have the resources to raise.  The burden falls heavier on poor defendants, and as a result disproportionately on groups like [[African-Americans]], [[Hispanics]], and [[native Americans]].  In many cases, defendants face a lesser criminal penalty for a [[conviction]] than they actually spend awaiting their trial date.  In the United States, the most common sentence handed out for a [[guilty]] [[verdict]] is now "[[time served]]".  In Canada, the practice of crediting the defendant with two days against sentence for every one day spent in pre-trial custody has arisen.  However, in both cases, this practice tends to deny the prisoner the opportunity for parole (which is often available to prisoners who have served at least one-third of their custodial sentence) or time off for good behavior (which is often automatic after a prisoner has served two-thirds of their sentence).

In addition, remand facilities are often run at the [[municipal]] level.  They tend to be much older facilities than [[penitentiary|penitentiaries]] or [[reformatory|reformatories]], and many date back to the 19th century.  Many are overcrowded and are subject to a high degree of turnover.  Prisons like [[New York City]]'s [[Riker's Island]] and [[Toronto]]'s [[Don Jail]] have become as notorious as high security prisons for violence.  In Canada, the rule is now that one day spent in remand in "The Don" is counted as three days against any eventual sentence that may be imposed.

Additionally, remand prisons often find themselves home to the [[mentally ill]], as mental health facilities are closed.
