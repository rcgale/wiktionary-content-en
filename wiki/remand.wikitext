'''Remand''' is the [[imprisonment]] of [[suspect]]s awaiting trial. A prisoner who is denied [[bail]] is held in a prison on remand.

In most countries, remand prisoners are considered [[innocent until proven guilty]] by a [[court]] and are granted additional benefits to those of sentenced prisoners such as 

*wear own clothes rather than prison uniform
*voting in elections
*may not have to work or attend education
*may be entitled to additional visiting hours per week

Remand prisoners are usually detained separately from sentenced prisoners, however, due to prison overcrowding they are often held in a shared accomodation with sentenced prisoners.

Remand can cause hardship and a punishment for a suspect, even though he or she has not yet been sentenced.
