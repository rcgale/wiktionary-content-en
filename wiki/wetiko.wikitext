A [[Native American]] term '''wetiko''' (wet-ee-ko) for the amoral and predatory behavior of the European invaders. Meaning that they consumed others, their lands and life forces by physical or economic enslavement [http://www.solonline.org/repository/file?item_id=8808336].

The term derives probably from the Algonquian root word "witiku", though throughout the tribes and times the term's spelling varies: Wendigo, Windego, '''Wetiko''', Windago, Windikouk, and so on.

Wetiko (the word for cannibal in the [[Cree]] language) also a name given to [[Bigfoot]]/Sasqatch by Cree Indians.
