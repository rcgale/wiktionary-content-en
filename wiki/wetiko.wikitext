'''Wetiko''' (wet-ee-ko) is the [[Native American]] term for what they felt as the amoral and predatory behavior of the [[European]]s: that they consumed others' lands lives by physical or economic enslavement.  The term probably derives from the [[Algonquian]] root word "witiku", though the term's exact spelling varies throughout the tribes and the times: wendigo, windego, wetiko, windago, windikouk, and so on.

Wetiko (the word for [[cannibal]] in the [[Cree]] language) was also a name given to [[Bigfoot]]/Sasqatch by the Cree Indians.
