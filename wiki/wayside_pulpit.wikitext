Signs in front of churches and other religious institutions, whose messages are changed periodically and are often scriptural or other type quotations, are called "Wayside Pulpits."

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarian_Universalist Unitarian Universalist]  Association has provided 
congregations and communities spiritual refreshment in the form 
of the Wayside Community Pulpit for four decades.
