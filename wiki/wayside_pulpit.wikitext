Signs in front of churches and other religious institutions, whose messages are changed periodically and are often scriptural or other type quotations, are called "Wayside Pulpits."

The Unitarian Universalist Association has provided 
congregations and communities spiritual refreshment in the form 
of the Wayside Community Pulpit for four decades.
