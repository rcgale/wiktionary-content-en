Ruin many or all things over a large area, such as most or all buildings of a city, or cities of a region, or trees of a forest.  Or, destroy a whole collection of related ideas, beliefs, and strongly held opinions.  Break beyond recovery or repair so that the only options are abandonment or the clearing away of useless remains (if any) and starting over.  Ruin that is shocking, not only showing that something was not indestructable, but also that it was in danger and could and would be assailed.
