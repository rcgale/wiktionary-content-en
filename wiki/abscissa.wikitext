English plural '''Abscissas'''<br>
Latin plural '''Abscissæ'''
#''(Geometry):'' One of the elements of reference by which a point, as of a curve, is referred to a system of fixed [[rectilineal]] [[coördinate]] axes. When referred to two [[intersecting]] axes, one of them called the axis of [[abscissas]], or of X, and the other the axis of [[ordinate]]s, or of Y, the ''abscissa'' of the point is the distance cut off from the axis of X by a line drawn through it and parallel to the axis of Y. When a point in space is referred to three axes having a common [[intersection]], the ''abscissa'' may be the distance measured parallel to either of them, from the point to the plane of the other two axes. [[Abscissas]] and ordinates taken together are called [[coördinates]]. -- OX or PY is the ''abscissa'' of the point P of the curve, OY or PX its ordinate, the intersecting lines OX and OY being the axes of abscissas and ordinates [[respectively]], and the point O their origin.
