#:'''Quotations'''
#:*'''1786''': What was the particular form or construction of the almaine ryvetts, I have not been able to discover, but [[conjecture]] they were [[denominated]] ryvetts, from having the [[joint]]s of the [[arm]] made [[flexible]] by means of [[rivet]]s, a [[contrivance]] possibly [[invent]]ed or [[perfect]]ed in Germany, or perhaps that country might be famous for a [[manufactory]] of this kind of [[armour]]. &mdash; Francis Grose, ''A Treatise on Ancient Armour and Weapons'', page 20.
