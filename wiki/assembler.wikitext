==Assembler==

'''Noun''', ''Computer terminology''

#An '''Assembler''' is a [[computer]] [[programming]] tool that reads [[source code]] files written in [[Assembly Language]] and produces a number of output files. One of these, the [[Object]] file, can then be submitted to a [[linker]] which generates a working computer program.
The other output files are generated to assist the [[programmer]] with [[debugging]].

#Assembler is also used as a shorthand reference to the programming language. 
*Example: ''I wrote that in Assembler.''
