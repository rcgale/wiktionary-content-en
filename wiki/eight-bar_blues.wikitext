The eight bar blues consists of a traditional blues sequence of chords with the following pattern:

I - I - IV - I - V - IV - I - V

where I, IV and V represents the tonic, the fourth and the fifth tones of the scale.

For example:

If somebody is playing an 8-bar blues in E major, the sequence of chords would be:

E - E - A - E - B - A - E - B

Often, an intermediate chord is played betwen fourth and fifth tone. The last chord in the sequence is known as "Turn Around" because it closes the cycle calling the first chord and making natural the repetition of the sequence.
