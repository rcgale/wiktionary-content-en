== Character ==
The Cyrillic '''pálochka''' ([[Ӏ]]) (Russian [[палочка]], a stick) is a [[letter]] added to the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] when used in writing several [[Caucasian languages]], such as [[Abaza]], [[Adyghe]], [[Avar]], [[Chechen]], [[Dargva]], [[Ingush]], [[Kabardian]], [[Lak]], [[Lezgian]] and [[Tabasaran]].

The ''palochka'' usually signals that a preceding consonant is an [[Ejective consonant|ejective]] (often described as sounding like a "spat" consonant). In some of the languages that use the ''palochka'', it represents a [[glottal stop]] ([[ʔ]]) as well.

It looks exactly like uppercase Latin [[I|letter I]], but has no lowercase form.
