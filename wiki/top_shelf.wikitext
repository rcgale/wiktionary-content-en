'''Top Shelf''' is slang for "best" or "high quality". This term originated in [[England]].  It comes from the practice of keeping the best quality [[liquor]]s on the top shelf of a [[Bar (counter)|bar]].  This led to well-respected or upscale brands being referred to as "top shelf" brands.

In modern [[English language|English]] parlance, the term top shelf [[magazine]] is used to refer to soft-core [[pornography]] sold through newsagents.  These magazines are positioned so as to be inaccessible to minors (those under 18) and out of the normal line of sight of the majority of shoppers. Thus, in the [[UK]] softcore [[pornographic]] magazines (available through newsagents) are often referred to as to top shelf magazines.  Hard-core pornography is legally available in the UK only through licensed sex shops.
