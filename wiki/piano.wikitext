===Etymology===
Short form of '''[[pianoforte]]''', from Italian '''[[piano]]''' (soft) + '''[[forte]]''' (strong).  So named because older keyboard instruments, notably the [[harpsichord]] and the [[clavier]], could not produce varied volumes.  

===Noun===
'''piano''', plural '''[[pianos]]'''

#A keyboard musical instrument, usually ranging over seven octaves, with white and black keys, similar to an organ. Most white keys play one full step in pitch from each other, while the black ones play a half-step from the adjacent white. It may be played by a person or play itself.
