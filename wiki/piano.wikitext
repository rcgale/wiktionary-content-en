===Etymology===

:Short form of ''pianoforte'', from Italian ''piano'' (soft) + ''forte'' (strong).  So named because older keyboard instruments, notably the [[harpsichord]] and the [[clavier]], could not produce varied volumes.  

===Usage===

:''Piano'' is now the usual term for the musical instrument.  ''Pianoforte'' is old-fashioned.

===Noun===
'''piano'''
:A keyboard musical instrument, usually ranging five octaves, with white and black keys. The white keys play one full tone from each other, while the black ones play a semi-tone from the adjacent white.
