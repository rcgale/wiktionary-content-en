'''Even money''' is a [[gambling]] term describing a wagering [[proposition]] in which the [[odds]] are even -- in other words, if one were to lose the bet, one stood to lose the same amount of money that the winner of the bet would win (less, of course, the [[vigorish]] or "juice").

The term has come to have meaning in the wider [[English language|English]] usage beyond actual gambling, however, as a way of describing an event whose occurrence is somewhat likely to happen, but far from inevitable, as in "It's even money that it will rain today."
