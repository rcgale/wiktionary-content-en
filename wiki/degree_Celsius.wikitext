===Eytmology===
[[degree]] and [[Celsius]]

===Noun===
'''degree Celsius''' (''plural'' '''degrees Celsius''')

#A [[metric]] [[unit]] of [[temperature]], a [[derived unit]] of the [[International System of Units]].  Symbol: °C

====Usage note====
*In technical contexts, the symbol should always include both the degree symbol ° and the C identifying the scale, as the symbol C alone is used for coulombs.  In informal usage, where the meaning is clear, the degree symbol is sometimes omitted (in part because the degree symbol is generally not one of the keys on a keyboard).
