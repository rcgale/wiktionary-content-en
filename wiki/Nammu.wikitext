After the sumerian mythology, around year 4000 BC, a sumerian couple lived in Dilmun (identified today as the isle of Bahrain) : Nammu and her husband An.

After her death, Nammu became the Goddess of the sea (abzu) and An became the God of the Sky.
Nammu was the mother and ancestor of all the sumerian gods. 
Nammu will be later called : Ningal and An : Nanna (their Akkadian names).
