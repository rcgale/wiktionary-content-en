===Etymology===
French ''-able'', Latin ''-abilis''
===Suffix===
#An adjective suffix now usually in a passive sense; able to be; fit to be; expressing capacity or worthiness in a passive sense; as
#:mov'''able''': able to be moved;
#:amend'''able''', able to be amended; 
#:blam'''able''', fit to be blamed; 
#:sal'''able'''.
====Note====
*The form '''-ible''' is used in the same sense.
*It is difficult to say when we are not to use '''-able''' instead of '''-ible'''. Yet a rule may be laid down as to when we are to use it. To all verbs, then, from the Anglo-Saxon, to all based on the uncorrupted infinitival stems of Latin verbs of the first conjugation, and to all substantives, whencesoever sprung, we annex '''-able''' only. - [[Fitzed.
