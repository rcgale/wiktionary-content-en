====Note====
*The form '''[[-ible]]''' is used in the same sense.
*It is difficult to say when we are not to use '''-able''' instead of '''-ible'''. Yet a rule may be laid down as to when we are to use it. To all verbs, then, from the Anglo-Saxon, to all based on the uncorrupted infinitival stems of Latin verbs of the first conjugation, and to all substantives, whencesoever sprung, we annex '''-able''' only. - [[Fitzed.
