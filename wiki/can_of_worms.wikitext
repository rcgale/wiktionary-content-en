'''can of worms'''
# A very complex, or unsolvable problem.  Once the topic is raised, subsequent or related problems will also need to be addressed.
# An issue whose resolution is difficult, contentious, or unusually complicated.  The problem itself does not have to be complex.  For example, stating that a certain individual was the greatest person who ever lived would definitely open a can of worms.
