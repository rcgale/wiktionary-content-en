==English==

===Etymology===
From [[God]]'s [[wound]]s; in [[medieval]] times, people would curse on God's body parts rather than breaking the [[w:Ten commandments|third commandment]] (Do not use the Lord's name in [[vain]] [[oath]]s).  In this case, the exclamation refers to [[Christ]]'s wounds leading up to the [[crucifixion]].  Compare [[strewth]], [[blimey]], [['sblood]].

===Interjection===
'''Zounds!'''
#An exclamation formerly used as an oath, and an expression of anger or wonder.
#an exclamation of [[surprise]]
